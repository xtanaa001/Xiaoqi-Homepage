        paperAbstract : "<p>In this paper, we study sequential auctions with two budget constrained bidders and any number of identical items. All prior results on such auctions consider only two items. We construct a canonical outcome of the auction that is the only natural equilibrium and is unique under a refinement of subgame perfect equilibria. We show  certain interesting properties of  this equilibrium; for instance, we show that the prices decrease as the auction progresses. This phenomenon has been observed in many experiments and previous theoretic work attributed it to features such as uncertainty in the supply or risk averse bidders. We show that such features are not needed for this phenomenon and that it arises purely from the most essential features: budget constraints and the sequential nature of the auction. A little surprisingly we also show that in this equilibrium one agent wins all his items in the beginning and then the other agent wins the rest. The major difficulty in analyzing such sequential auctions has been in understanding how the selling prices of the first few rounds affect the utilities of the agents in the later rounds. We tackle this difficulty by identifying certain key properties of the auction and the proof is via a joint induction on all of them. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p> > Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) introduce the problem of online matching with stochastic rewards, where edges are associated with success probabilities and a match succeeds with the probability of the corresponding edge. It is one of the few online matching problems that have defied the randomized online primal dual framework by Devanur, Jain, and Kleinberg (SODA 2013) thus far. This paper unlocks the power of randomized online primal dual in online matching with stochastic rewards by employing the configuration linear program rather than the standard matching linear program used in previous works. Our main result is a <em class=math>0.572</em> competitive algorithm for the case of vanishing and unequal probabilities, improving the best previous bound of <em class=math>0.534</em> by Mehta, Waggoner, and Zadimoghaddam (SODA 2015) and, in fact, is even better than the best previous bound of <em class=math>0.567</em> by Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) for the more restricted case of vanishing and equal probabilities. For vanishing and equal probabilities, we get a better competitive ratio of <em class=math>0.576</em>. Our results further generalize to the vertex-weighted case due to the intrinsic robustness of the randomized online primal dual analysis.</p>",

(2015), we assume that the intermediary only has partial information about the buyer's value. We consider three different models of information, with increasing order of difficulty. In the first model, we assume that the intermediary's information allows him to construct a probability distribution of the buyer's value. Next we consider the sample complexity model, where we assume that the intermediary only sees samples from this distribution. Finally, we consider a bandit online learning model, where the intermediary can only observe past purchasing decisions of the buyer, rather than her exact value. For each of these models, we present algorithms to compute optimal or near optimal market segmentation.</p>",

This is fundamentally different from the previous approaches that rely on either constructing an ϵ-net of the mechanism space, explicitly or implicitly via statistical learning theory, or learning an approximately accurate version of the virtual values.

Previous algorithms, e.g., empirical pricing, do not provide non-trivial regret rounds in this setting in general. We introduce algorithms that obtain small regret against non-myopic bidders either when the market is large, i.e., no bidder appears in a constant fraction of the rounds, or when the bidders are impatient, i.e., they discount future utility by some factor mildly bounded away from one. Our approach carefully controls what information is revealed to each bidder, and builds on techniques from differentially private online learning as well as the recent line of works on jointly differentially private algorithms.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>We introduce a fully online model of maximum cardinality matching in which all vertices arrive online. On the arrival of a vertex, its incident edges to previously-arrived vertices are revealed. Each vertex has a deadline that is after all its neighbors' arrivals. If a vertex remains unmatched until its deadline, the algorithm must then irrevocably either match it to an unmatched neighbor, or leave it unmatched. The model generalizes the existing one-sided online model and is motivated by applications including ride-sharing platforms, real-estate agency, etc. We show that the Ranking algorithm by Karp et al. (STOC 1990) is <em class=math>0.5211</em>-competitive in our fully online model for general graphs. Our analysis brings a novel charging mechanic into the randomized primal dual technique by Devanur et al. (SODA 2013), allowing a vertex other than the two endpoints of a matched edge to share the gain. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of Ranking that beats <em class=math>0.5</em> on general graphs in an online matching problem, a first step towards solving the open problem by Karp et al.

If the graph is bipartite, we show that the competitive ratio of Ranking is between <em class=math>0.5541</em> and <em class=math>0.5671</em>.

The goal is to maximize the value of the final feasible set under some monotone submodular function, to which the algorithm has oracle access. For <em class=math>k</em>-uniform matroids, we give a deterministic algorithm with competitive ratio at least <em class=math>0.2959</em>, and the ratio approaches roughly <em class=math>0.3178</em> as <em class=math>k</em> approaches infinity, improving the previous best ratio of <em class=math>0.25</em> by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014), Buchbinder et al.

        paperAbstract : "<p>Traditionally, the Bayesian optimal auction design problem has been considered either when the bidder values are i.i.d, or when each bidder is individually identifiable via her value distribution. The latter is a reasonable approach when the bidders can be classified into a few categories, but there are many instances where the classification of bidders is a continuum. For example, the classification of the bidders may be based on their annual income, their propensity to buy an item based on past behavior, or in the case of ad auctions, the click through rate of their ads. We introduce an alternate model that captures this aspect, where bidders are a priori identical, but can be distinguished based (only) on some side information the auctioneer obtains at the time of the auction. We extend the sample complexity approach of Dhangwatnotai et al. and Cole and Roughgarden to this model and obtain almost matching upper and lower bounds. As an aside, we obtain a revenue monotonicity lemma which may be of independent interest. We also show how to use Empirical Risk Minimization techniques to improve the sample complexity bound of Cole and Roughgarden for the non-identical but independent value distribution case.</p>",

The sought-after prediction aggregate is the equilibrium price. However, traders with budget constraints are restricted in their ability to impact the market price on their own. We give a detailed characterization of optimal trades in the presence of budget constraints in a prediction market with a cost-function-based automated market maker. As a concrete application of our characterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget additivity: two traders with budgets <em class=math>B</em> and <em class=math>B'</em> and the same beliefs would have a combined impact equal to a single trader with budget <em class=math>B + B'</em>. That way, even if a single trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can have the same desired effect. The sufficient conditions amount to verifying that the payoff vectors at outcomes form \"acute angles\". Our analysis borrows heavily from techniques in convex analysis and builds on the geometric notion of Bregman divergence. We show that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic market scoring rule is budget additive for affinely independent payoffs, but the quadratic market scoring rule is not. Our results may be used both descriptively, to understand if a particular market maker is affected by budget constraints or not, and prescriptively, as a recipe to construct markets.</p>",

        paperAbstract: "<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in speed scaling algorithms, where a set of jobs need to be scheduled on a machine with variable speed so as to optimize the flow-times of the jobs and the energy consumed by the machine. A series of results have culminated in constant-competitive algorithms for this problem in the clairvoyant model, i.e., when job parameters are revealed on releasing a job (Bansal, Pruhs, and Stein, SODA 2007; Bansal, Chan, and Pruhs, SODA 2009). Our main contribution in this paper is the first constant-competitive speed scaling algorithm in the non-clairvoyant model, which is typically used in the scheduling literature to model practical settings where job volume is revealed only after the job has been completely processed. Unlike in the clairvoyant model, the speed scaling problem in the non-clairvoyant model is non-trivial even for a single job. Our non-clairvoyant algorithm is defined by using the existing clairvoyant algorithm in a novel inductive way, which then leads to an inductive analytical tool that may be of independent interest for other online optimization problems. We also give additional algorithmic results and lower bounds for speed scaling on multiple identical parallel machines.</p>",

Our lower bound approach borrows tools from differential privacy and information theory, and we believe it could find further applications in auction theory.</p> <p>Our second set of results considers the single-sample case. For regular distributions, we prove that no pricing strategy is better than <em class=math>1/2</em>-approximate. For MHR distributions, however, we give a simple pricing strategy that guarantees expected revenue at least <em class=math>0.589</em> times the maximum possible.  We also prove that no pricing strategy achieves an approximation guarantee better than <em class=math>e/4 &#8776; .68</em>. Our positive results for these single-agent problems directly lead to improved multi-agent prior-independent mechanisms.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>We consider a private variant of the classical allocation problem: given <em>m</em> goods and <em>n</em> agents with individual, private valuation functions over bundles of goods, how can we partition the goods amongst the agents to maximize social welfare? Specifically, the valuation functions are sensitive information which the agents wish to keep private from arbitrary coalitions of other agents. An important special case is when each agent desires at most one good, and specifies her (private) value for each good: in this case, the problem is exactly the maximum-weight matching problem in a bipartite graph.</p><p>Private matching and allocation problems have not been considered in the differential privacy literature, and for good reason: they are plainly impossible to solve under the standard notion of differential privacy. Informally, the allocation must match agents to preferred goods in order to maximize social welfare, but this preference is exactly what agents wish to keep private! Therefore, we consider the problem under the recently introduced constraint of joint differential privacy: roughly, for any agent <em>i</em>, no coalition of agents excluding <em>i</em> should be able to learn about the valuation function of agent <em>i</em>. We first show that if there are a small number of identical copies of each good, then it is possible to efficiently and accurately solve the maximum weight matching problem while guaranteeing joint differential privacy. We then extend our techniques to the more general allocation problem, when bidder valuations satisfy the gross substitutes condition. Finally, we prove lower bounds demonstrating that the problem cannot be privately solved to non-trivial accuracy without requiring multiple copies of each type of good.</p>",

The set of ads that can be assigned to ad slots of the same page needs to satisfy various pre-specified constraints including exclusion constraints, diversity constraints, and the like. Upon arrival of a user, the ad serving system needs to allocate a set of ads to the current web-page respecting these per-page allocation constraints. Previous slot-based settings ignore the important concept of a page, and may lead to highly suboptimal results in general. In this paper, motivated by these applications in display advertising and inspired by the submodular welfare maximization problem with online bidders, we study a general class of page-based ad allocation problems, present the first (tight) constant-factor approximation algorithms for these problems, and confirm the performance of our algorithms experimentally on real-world data sets.</p><p>A key technical ingredient of our results is a novel primal-dual analysis for handling free-disposal, which updates dual variables using a \"level function\" instead of a single level, and unifies with previous analyses of related problems. This new analysis method allows us to handle arbitrarily complicated allocation constraints for each page. Our main result is an algorithm that achieves a <em class=math>1-1/e-o(1)</em> competitive ratio. Moreover, our experiments on real-world data sets show significant improvements of our page-based algorithms compared to the slot-based algorithms.</p><p>Finally, we observe that our problem is closely related to the submodular welfare maximization (SWM) problem. In particular, we introduce a variant of the SWM problem with online bidders, and show how to solve this problem using our algorithm for whole page optimization.</p>",
