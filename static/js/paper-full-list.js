        paperAbstract : "<p> The two-settlement electricity markets are widely accepted. In current practice, the markets are cleared based on locational marginal prices. However, this market clearing scheme leaves arbitrage opportunities between day-ahead and real-time markets for strategic distribution system operators (DSOs). They can submit biased bids from their actual load forecasts in the dayahead market for additional benefits. Worse still, due to the high penetration of distributed energy resources, the impact of such strategic behaviors becomes increasingly severe as the uncertainties in DSOs’ load forecasts increase. In this paper, we first identify the profitable arbitrage opportunities of DSOs and the impact of uncertainties by a simplified analytical model. We then propose a Nash bargaining solution based market clearing scheme for real-time coordination between the transmission system operator and the DSOs. This scheme guarantees the fairness of net-benefit allocation among all the operators, prevents the strategic behaviors of DSOs, and helps the consistency between day-ahead commitment and real-time operation. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on both a simplified system and a practical power system testbed. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Battery swapping stations (BSSs) are one of the main types of electric vehicle (EV) refueling facilities. By battery swapping, EVs first replace their depleted batteries (DBs) with fully-charged ones, and then the demounted DBs can be recharged in charging facilities in a stand-alone mode, leading to a decouple between batteries and EVs during refueling. This paper targets the planning and operation of a network of geographically-distributed BSSs, termed as BSS-Net. In particular, we focus on two important decisions being made within two different timescales, namely a long-term decision on planning the initial inventory in each individual BSS, and a short-term decision on real-time vehicle-to-station (V2S) routing of EVs. We formulate a two-stage optimization problem and propose a two-step solution scheme. Specifically, in the first step, we determine the long-term initial inventory by sample average approximation, and the resulting planning decision leads to a maximized total expected revenue for the BSS-Net. Based on the optimal initial inventory, we design a randomized online algorithm in the second step to perform real-time V2S routing, without assuming any future EV arrival information. We rigorously prove that the worst-case performance of the randomized online algorithm is theoretically bounded by a closed-form competitive ratio.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p> Aggregation of demand-side flexibility plays a crucial role in helping improve the system-wide performance of power grids. However, less known is the potential negative impact of self-interested flexibility aggregators being strategic for their own benefits at the cost of other market participants and even system-wide performance. This paper aims to theoretically analyze this negative impact, as well as the corresponding mitigation method. Specifically, we consider a strategic aggregator derives the optimal bidding strategy of the flexibility bounds (for cumulative energy and instantaneous power consumption) and trades electricity in a pool. A multi-period bi-level program with a DC network setup is considered. The upper-level problem represents the aggregator’s cost minimization, and the lower-level problem represents the market clearing process. Based on this bi-level formulation, our theoretical analysis shows that the potential negative impacts of the strategic behavior on the system generation cost, the payments of the fixed loads and non-strategic aggregators depend on the bus locations of both the strategic and non-strategic aggregators. We propose to additionally charge the strategic aggregator for the newly introduced congestion so as to avoid the system performance degradation. The analytical results are validated via simulations.</p>",

A provider allocates multiple types of capacity-limited resources to customers that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner.

The provider charges payment from customers who purchase a bundle of resources and incurs an increasing supply cost with respect to the totality of resources allocated. The goal is to maximize the social welfare, namely, the total valuation of customers for their purchased bundles, minus the total supply cost of the provider for all the resources that have been allocated.

Our pricing mechanism is optimal in the sense that no other online algorithms can achieve a better competitive ratio.

Although this one-dimensional flexibility has been extensively investigated both by research and industrial implementations, the expanding energy demand and the associated uncertainties still make the integration of a large population of EVs into power system reliably and economically greatly challenging. In this paper, we design an auction scheme via mechanism design to elicit two additional flexibilities from EVs, namely energy flexibility and deadline flexibility. An offline mechanism is firstly designed as a benchmark based on the famous Vickrey–Clark– Groves mechanism. Then based on the primal-dual approach, we propose an online auction, in which all bids are truthful, the loss of social welfare is bounded by competitive ratio, and the mechanism can be implemented in polynomial time. By the numerical results, we quantitatively show that both the power system operators and individual EVs can benefit from the integration of the multi-dimensional flexibilities through our proposed mechanisms.</p>",

A BCS has a certain number of charging bays and maintains a dynamic inventory of fully charged batteries (FBs). This paper studies a BCS scheduling (BCSS) problem whose target is to schedule the charging processes of the charging bays such that the charging cost is minimized while satisfying the FB demand. Specifically, the BCSS problem has two types of operations: 1) loading DBs into the charging bays and then unloading them to the FB inventory when they are fully charged and 2) controlling the charging rate of each charging bay. We formulate the BCSS problem as a mixed-integer program with quadratic battery degradation cost. A generalized benders decomposition algorithm is then developed to solve the problem efficiently. The salience of the developed algorithm is that: 1) each charging bay can solve its own subproblem separately and 2) each subproblem can be further partitioned into multiple independent and identically structured quadratic programming problems, and thus the algorithm facilitates an efficient parallel implementation. We perform extensive real data simulation to validate the optimization model and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</p>",

First, we propose a three-layer architecture for the convergence of future mobility and energy systems. For each layer, we give a brief overview of the disruptive transformations that directly contribute to the rise of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. Second, we propose the concept of autonomous flexibility-on-demand (AFoD), as an energy service platform built directly on existing infrastructures of AMoD systems. In the vision of AFoD, autonomous electric vehicles provide charging flexibilities as a service on demand in energy systems. Third, we analyze and compare AMoD and AFoD, and we identify four key decisions that, if appropriately coordinated, will create a synergy between AMoD and AFoD. Finally, we discuss key challenges towards the success of AMoD and AFoD in future smart cities and present some key research directions regarding the system-wide coordination between AMoD and AFoD.</p>",

Instead of assigning stations to each EV customer directly, we provide a recommendation, including a list of station-price pairs that are available for EV battery swapping services, for customers to choose. Compared with assignment, recommendation is closer to reality for scenarios lacking incentives for the cooperation of customers such as the battery swapping services of private EVs. In this paper, we model customers’ behavior by their choice probability given a particular recommendation, which can be readily obtained based on analytics techniques once the real data are available. We propose an online V2S recommendation algorithm, which aims at maximizing the expected revenue of a group of battery swapping stations (BSSs) and ensuring the quality service of EV customers. Leveraging the primal-dual analysis, we show that the loss of revenue due to online EV arrivals is theoretically bounded by a provable competitive ratio. Moreover, numerical tests also validate that the proposed online algorithm can significantly outperform benchmarks in maximizing revenues in online settings.</p>",

However, inappropriate battery charging operation in BSCSs cannot only incur unnecessary high charging cost but also threaten the reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we aim at obtaining an optimal charging operation policy for a single BSCS to minimize its charging cost while ensuring its quality-of-service. Leveraging the novel queueing network model, we propose to formulate the charging operation problem as a constrained Markov decision process and derive the optimal policy by the standard Lagrangian method and dynamic programming. To avoid the curse of dimensionality in practical large-scale systems, we further analyze the structure of the optimal policy and transform the dynamic programming procedure into an equivalent threshold optimization problem with a discrete separable convex objective function. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithms. This paper also shows the impact of the system parameters (e.g., numbers of batteries and chargers) on the average cost under the optimal charging policy, which gives rich insights into the infrastructure planning of future BSCS networks.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The growing developments in vehicular networks and vehicular Internet services have yielded a variety of computation-intensive applications, resulting in great pressure on vehicles equipped with limited computation resources. The cloud/ edge-based service, which enables in-motion vehicles to actively offload computation tasks to cloud/edge servers, has provided a promising approach to address the intensive computation burden. However, due to the possibility of disclosing private data, offloading computation tasks suffers from potential eavesdropping attacks. In this article, we focus on the eavesdropping attack when vehicular users (VUs) deliver computation tasks to cloud/edge servers over radio frequency channels. We take the tool of physical layer security and investigate resource management for secrecy provisioning when the VUs offload computation tasks. We then discuss three promising technologies, including non-orthogonal multiple access, multi-access assisted computation offloading, and mobility- and delay-aware offloading, which facilitate the enhancement of secrecy against the eavesdropping attack. Finally, as a detailed example of the multi-access assisted computation offloading, we present a case study on the optimal dual-connectivity-assisted computation task offloading with secrecy provisioning and show the performance of the proposed computation offloading.</p>",

Consequently, the mismatch between the power supply and demand may happen frequently and, thus, lead to frequency deviation from its nominal value. To avoid this scenario, demand-side flexibility has been widely considered to provide frequency regulation services. In this paper, we focus on the flexibility of thermal systems in buildings and propose a hierarchical demand-response market with a three-step algorithm to model the interactions among three entities: the independent system operators (ISOs), aggregators, and end users. The flexibility from the end users is aggregated in step 1, which is based on the incentive and electricity prices broadcasted by the aggregator. A robust optimization approach is adopted to improve the user’s decision under the electricity price uncertainty. To model the interaction between the ISO and aggregators in step 2, a bilevel optimization problem is solved, in which the ISO seeks to minimize its cost, while the aggregators maximize their benefits in the day-ahead market. In step 3, each aggregator allocates its successful trading reserve among end users based on their performance scores.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>A battery swapping and charging station (BSCS) is an energy refueling station, where (i) electric vehicles (EVs) with depleted batteries (DBs) can swap their DBs for fully-charged ones, and (ii) the swapped DBs are then charged until they are fully-charged. Successful deployment of a BSCS system necessitates a careful planning of swapping- and chargingrelated infrastructures, and thus a comprehensive performance evaluation of the BSCS is becoming crucial. This paper studies such a performance evaluation problem with a novel mixed queueing network (MQN) model and validates this model with extensive numerical simulation. We adopt the EVs’ blocking probability as our quality-of-service measure and focus on studying the impact of the key parameters of the BSCS (e.g., the numbers of parking spaces, swapping islands, chargers, and batteries) on the blocking probability. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for showing the ergodicity of the MQN when the number of batteries approaches infinity, and further prove that the blocking probability has two different types of asymptotic behaviors. Meanwhile, for each type of asymptotic behavior, we analytically derive the asymptotic lower bound of the blocking probability.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Historically, transportation electrification has been largely hindered by the limited battery capacity and the long charging time. Battery swapping has emerged as one promising technology to mitigate these problems. A centralised battery charging station (BCS) is responsible for charging depleted batteries (DBs) and providing fully-charged batteries (FBs) for multiple geographically-distributed battery swapping stations (BSSs) so that they can carry out battery swapping services. Facilitated by the recent advancement in sensor and communication technologies, one salient advantage of this centralised approach lies in its convenience to better utilise dual energy sources (i.e. the traditional power grid and local renewable energy generators). This is achieved via optimising the charging processes of a large number of DBs. In this study, the authors propose an optimisation framework for a centralised BCS to minimise the energy cost from the dual energy sources to satisfy the FB demands from multiple BSSs. Particularly, the power dispatch problem in the day-ahead and real-time electricity markets is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimisation through consideration of the intermittent renewable energy. Numerical simulations show that the proposed optimised power dispatch is capable of achieving cost saving of 76% compared with the benchmark, subject to the limited information available in day-ahead.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The cooperation of multiple networked microgrids (MGs) can alleviate the mismatch problem between distributed generation and demand and reduce the overall cost of the power system. Energy management with direct energy exchange among MGs is a promising approach for improving energy efficiency. However, existing methods on microgrid cooperation usually overlook the underlying distribution network with operating constraints (e.g., voltage tolerance and power flow constraints). Hence the results may not be applicable to actual systems. This paper studies the energy management problem of multiple MGs that are interconnected by both the direct current (DC) energy exchange network and the alternating current (AC) traditional distribution networks. In our problem, each MG is equipped with renewable energy generators as well as distributed storage devices. In order to handle the non-convex power flow constraints, we exploit the recent results of the exact optimal power flow (OPF) relaxation method which can equivalently transform the original non-convex problem into a second-order cone programming problem and efficiently determine the optimal solution successfully. The objective of our problem is to minimize the overall energy cost in a distribution network consisting of multiple MGs, with the practical operating constraints (e.g., power balance and the battery’s operational constraints) explicitly incorporated. Considering the privacy and scalability, we propose a distributed algorithm with convergence assurance based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We also implement our method based on the model predictive control (MPC) approach in order to handle the forecasting errors of the renewable energy generation. Simulations are made for different MG exchange topologies on three radial distribution network testbeds. Numerical results demonstrate that certain topologies are more favorable than others, and the cooperation strategy for the energy exchange is significantly affected by the MGs’ locations in the distribution network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>To accommodate the increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration in distribution grid, coordinated EV charging has been extensively studied in the literature. However, most of the existing works optimistically consider the EV charging rate as a continuous variable and implicitly ignore the capacity limitation in distribution transformers, which both have great impact on the efficiency and stability of practical grid operation. Towards a more realistic setting, this paper formulates the EV coordinated discrete charging problem as two successive binary programs. The first one is designed to achieve a desired aggregate load profile (e.g., valley-filling profile) at the distribution grid level while taking into account the capacity constraints of distribution transformers. Leveraging the properties of separable convex function and total unimodularity, the problem is transformed into an equivalent linear program, which can be solved efficiently and optimally. The second problem aims to minimize the total number of on-off switchings of all the EVs’ charging profiles while preserving the optimality of the former problem. We prove the second problem is NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm to approximately achieve our target in an iterative manner. Case studies confirm the validity of our proposed scheduling methods and indicate our algorithm’s potential for real-time implementations.</p>",

In order to reduce the communication and computational complexity of integrating the huge number of DERs into the power system operation, the distribution system operator (DSO) is considered as the central controller to take charge of the dispatch of all the DERs within a distribution network. Through the exchange of boundary power flows and control signals, the independent system operator (ISO) coordinates all the DSOs to achieve certain social objective. In this paper, we study the interactions between the ISO and all the DSOs in both the dayahead market and the real-time balancing market. Particularly, we identify that the locational marginal price (LMP) based realtime market is unfair and discourages the integration of DERs. To achieve a win-win solution for both the ISO and the DSOs, we propose a real-time coordination mechanism to determine the power dispatch and the corresponding charge/payments via a Nash bargaining problem. Numerical results show that our proposed mechanism guarantees that the ISO and all the DSOs can cooperatively maximize the social welfare and share the benefits fairly due to the cooperation.</p>",

However, how to model and evaluate the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) of the energy consumers (such as the flexibilities in terms of energy, power, time period and locations, etc.) is an important and challenging issue. To handle this, we propose a day-ahead market design for the MDF services. In this market, the MDF aggregators need to submit the characteristics of their virtual battery models and parametric reward functions, which represent the aggregate load flexibilities and the required remunerations, respectively. One key feature of this new market is that the system operator is allowed to accept only a portion of every bid instead of the whole of them. This can bring more flexibilities for the operator to minimize the total system cost. With various case studies on a 6-bus transmission network, we show that this market can help flatten the locational marginal prices (LMPs) across the peak load period. Moreover, we show that even if the MDF bids at different buses are the same, the clearing results can be quite different, which reflect the practical values of different load flexibilities from the perspective of the system operator.</p>",

The existence of local energy market provides new opportunities for the energy consumers and the distributed energy sellers to perform the local energy trading in a cooperative manner such that they all can benefit. This paper first quantifies the respective benefits of the energy consumers and the sellers from the local trading and then investigates how they can optimize their benefits by controlling their energy scheduling in response to the LTC’s pricing.

Existing works on cooperative MGs usually consider the high-level energy sharing and trading strategies but little about the physical constraints (e.g. voltage tolerance and power flow constraints) in the underlying distribution network. Hence, their solutions may not be applicable to practical power systems. This paper proposes an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the overall energy cost and the P2P energy sharing losses in a distribution network consisting of multiple MGs and explicitly incorporates the practical constraints (e.g., power balance and battery’s operational constraints). The proposed optimization problem is difficult to solve directly due to the non-convex constraints. Nevertheless, motivated by the very recent result in radial distribution networks, the proposed non-convex optimization problem can be relaxed to a secondorder cone programming (SOCP) problem without incurring any loss of optimality. We apply the proposed problem to a radial distribution network testbed and obtain the corresponding optimal energy management strategy, which exploits the diversified energy consumption profiles to dynamically coordinate multiple MGs and reduces the total energy bill of all MGs. Moreover, an interesting observation from the simulation results is that the cooperation scheme in the P2P sharing network is significantly affected by the MGs’ relative locations in the distribution network.</p>",

Current solutions often approach this problem by either the centralized non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or the decentralized smart controls but seldom both, rendering them impractical to some extent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of smart home energy management systems incorporating both approaches, so that accurate power consumption monitoring and intuitive interaction with the home appliances are simultaneously achieved. The smart components directly control the appliances, while the central controller coordinates the data collection and communication. The key feature is the capability of automatically mapping the appliances to their corresponding sockets, reducing the necessity for manual initial setup. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy and efficiency of the framework. We believe that our systems, if widely deployed, can benefit not only individual households by saving energy bills and simplifying life but also society by the big data generated.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The current mobile broadband market experiences major growth in data demand and average revenue loss. To remain profitable from the perspective of a service provider (SP), one needs to maximize revenue as much as possible by making subscribers satisfied within the limited budget. On the other hand, traffic demands are moving toward supporting the wide range of heterogeneous applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we consider two related packet scheduling problems, i.e., long-term and short-term approaches in the 4th generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) system. In the longterm approach, the long-term average revenue of SP subject to the long-term QoS constraints for heterogeneous traffic demands is optimized. The problem is first formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem, of which the optimal control policy is achieved by utilizing the channel and queue information simultaneously. Subsequently, in the short-term approach, we consider the short-term revenue optimization problem which stochastically guarantees the short-term QoS for heterogeneous traffic demands through a set of chance constraints. To make the proposed chance-constrained programming problem computationally tractable, we use the Bernstein approximation technique to analytically approximate the chance constraint as a convex conservative constraint. Finally, the proposed packet scheduling schemes and solution methods are validated via numerical simulations.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>In this paper, we investigate optimal management of local energy trading in future smart micro-grid (SMG) via pricing. In SMG, energy consumers and providers, in addition to trading with utility company, can also perform local energy trading controlled by a local trading manager (LTM) for reaping benefits. We first quantify the benefits achieved by the consumers and providers from local trading and then formulate a two-layered optimization framework to investigate i) how the energy consumers and providers maximize their benefits via appropriately adjusting their local trading decisions in response to the LTM’s pricing, and ii) how the LTM adjusts its price in local market to benefit the consumers and providers as much as possible while guaranteeing a required gain for itself. We propose two algorithms to solve the layered optimization problem and perform numerical experiments with practical data set to validate the proposed local trading model and the algorithms.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations with battery swapping, as one promising energy supplement solution to cope with the increasing in EVs, demand a theoretical performance analysis framework. In this paper, we propose a queueing network model to serve as such a framework for battery swapping stations with a locally-charging mode. The model is a mixed queueing network with an open queue of EVs and a closed queue of batteries. Based on mild assumptions, we show the equilibrium equations for the queueing system, and the steady-state distribution is the solution of these finite equilibrium equations. In order to show the uniqueness of the solution, we prove the ergodicity of the system. Meanwhile, by leveraging the embedded Markov chain, we present an alternative yet much easier way to compute the steady-state distribution. Based on the steadystate distribution, various important performance indicators have been analytically determined. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the queueing network model and reveal rich insights for the infrastructure planning of practical battery swapping stations.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>This paper proposes a mathematical framework for finding the optimal energy trading policy with battery energy storage (BES) under a dynamic pricing environment. We have previously shown that finding the arbitrage value of BES with known historical price data can be solved by iterative linear programming. The objective of the present paper is to show that, when the price information remains unknown, finding the optimal economic value of lifetime-constrained BES falls within the purview of stochastic shortest path problems, and the optimal policy presents the property of a threshold structure. To overcome the dimensionality difficulty, we propose a structure-based aggregation method, i.e., Layer and Group, to construct optimal trading policies. The elegance of this approach lies in its circumventing of the need for exhausted value iteration over the entire state space. Instead, the approach works in a hierarchical and parallel fashion, thus significantly speeding up the convergence to the optimality. Extensive experimental results show that this approach can dramatically reduce the computational complexity, thus contributing to the computationally tractable optimality without requiring any approximation. Numerical simulation also demonstrates the validity of the proposed framework, and various trading insights for practical BES systems have been formed.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers have an urgent demand for fast battery refueling methods for long distance trip and emergency drive. A well-planned battery swapping station (BSS) network can be a promising solution to offer timely refueling services. However, an inappropriate battery recharging process in the BSS may not only violate the stabilization of the power grid by their large power consumption, but also increase the charging cost from the BSS operators’ point of view. In this paper, we aim to obtain the optimal charging policy to minimize the charging cost while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of the BSS. A novel queueing network model is proposed to capture the operation nature for an individual BSS. Based on practical assumptions, we formulate the charging schedule problem as a stochastic control problem and achieve the optimal charging policy by dynamic programming. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the performance of different policies for both stationary and non-stationary EV arrival cases. Numerical results show the importance of determining the number of total batteries and charging outlets held in the BSS. Our work gives insight for the future infrastructure planning and operational management of BSS network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>In this paper, we investigate the cooperative distributed energy generation and energy trading for future smart grid. In our model, a group of energy users, who are equipped with the capabilities of distributed energy generation, are allowed to trade energy in a cooperative manner with the goal to minimize their total energy-provisioning cost while meeting the local demand of each individual energy user. Moreover, each user also expects to benefit from the cooperative energy generation and trading with the others. Motivated by these objectives, we first jointly determine the optimal energy scheduling decisions for all energy users such that their total energy-provisioning cost can be minimized. Then, based on the optimal energy scheduling decisions, we further determine the optimal transaction costs associated with the users’ energy trading to ensure that each of them can positively benefit from the cooperation. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the advantages of the proposed cooperative energy generation and trading model as well as our proposed algorithms to achieve the optimal solutions.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), as one type of the storage systems, serves as a particularly important role for future power grid systems. However, since both the capital cost of BESS and the potential economic value vary dramatically for large-scale systems, the total cost induced by BESS remains a major source of uncertainty for potential power system operators when the limited lifetime of BESS is taken into account. Therefore, appropriate configuration and operation of BESS are of paramount importance for its deployments in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel model for BESS that attempts to capture the fact of limited lifetime and to exploit the potential economic value. We develop a finite horizon optimization model for BESS operators with unknown stopping-time. The stoppingtime is determined by the policy itself, which makes the problem technically challenging. We first propose an algorithm called Forward-iteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (FirLP), which solves the problem by iterating on every time instance and achieves the optimality. Subsequently, we observe that some time instances are not necessary to be iterated on. Thus, we propose Jumpiteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (JirLP). By utilizing a well defined jump step, we can avoid exhaustive iteration on those unnecessary time instances. We examine our model and algorithms with the real price data. The computational results further validate our model, and shows that our proposed JirLP can achieve optimality and reduce the unnecessary iterations by 50% in comparison with the FirLP.</p>",
