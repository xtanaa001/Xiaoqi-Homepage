        paperAbstract : "<p>We study two adversarial online allocation problems involving reusable resources: the online $k$-rental problem with fixed rental durations (kRental-Fixed) and a more general variant with variable rental durations (kRental-Variable). In both problems, a decision-maker manages $k$ identical reusable units and faces a sequence of rental requests over time. We develop theoretically grounded relax-and-round algorithms with provable competitive ratio guarantees for both settings. For kRental-Fixed, we present an optimal randomized algorithm that achieves the best possible competitive ratio. The algorithm first computes an optimal fractional allocation using a price-based approach, and then applies a novel lossless online rounding scheme to obtain an integral solution. For kRental-Variable, we first establish the impossibility of achieving lossless online rounding. We then introduce a limited-correlation rounding technique that treats each unit independently while introducing controlled dependencies across allocation decisions involving the same unit. Combined with a carefully-crafted price-based method for computing the fractional allocation, this approach yields an order-optimal competitive ratio for the variable-duration setting. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>This paper investigates the online conversion problem, which involves sequentially trading a divisible resource (e.g., energy) under dynamically changing prices to maximize profit. A key challenge in online conversion is managing decisions under horizon uncertainty, where the duration of trading is either known, revealed partway, or entirely unknown. We propose a unified algorithm that achieves optimal competitive guarantees across these horizon models, accounting for practical constraints such as box constraints, which limit the maximum allowable trade per step. Additionally, we extend the algorithm to a learning-augmented version, leveraging horizon predictions to adaptively balance performance: achieving near-optimal results when predictions are accurate while maintaining strong guarantees when predictions are unreliable. These results advance the understanding of online conversion under various degrees of horizon uncertainty and provide more practical strategies to address real world constraints.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement learning within a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial $q^{\\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy  with respect to a predefined policy set $\\Pi$, under the assumption that all value functions corresponding to policies in $\\Pi$ are linearly realizable. This framework adopts assumptions that are weaker than those in the $q^{\\pi}$-realizability setting yet stronger than those in the $q^*$-realizability setup. As a result, it provides a more practical model for reinforcement learning scenarios where function approximation naturally arise. We prove that learning an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy in this newly defined setting is computationally hard. More specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a parameterized greedy policy set (i.e., argmax) and, further, show that—unless NP = RP—an exponential lower bound (exponential in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis. Our hardness results mirror those obtained in the $q^*$-realizability settings, and suggest that computational difficulty persists even when the policy class $ \\Pi $ is expanded beyond the optimal policy, reinforcing the unbreakable nature of the computational hardness result regarding partial $ q^{\\pi} $-realizability under two important policy sets. To establish our negative result, our primary technical contribution is a reduction from two complexity problems, $\\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\\delta$-Max-3SAT$(b)$, to instances of our problem settings: GLinear-$\\kappa$-RL (under the greedy policy set) and SLinear-$\\kappa$-RL (under the softmax policy set), respectively. Our findings indicate that positive computational results are generally unattainable in the context of partial $ q^{\\pi} $-realizability, in sharp contrast to the $ q^{\\pi} $-realizability setting under a generative access model.</p>",

Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution using a resource reservation approach---referred to as the \textit{set-aside} mechanism---to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in practical settings. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p> This paper introduces a novel mechanism for online allocation with multi-phase, non-separable regularizers, termed Cap-and-Penalize (\CnP), inspired by real-world applications such as cap-and-tax policies in carbon pricing. The \CnP regularizer models a multi-phase cost structure, imposing a monotone convex penalty when total allocation exceeds a predefined level (soft cap) and enforcing a strict limit (hard cap) beyond which allocation is prohibited. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we propose an online mechanism for \CnP-regularized allocation without per-step resource constraints, which operates as a simple and intuitive posted-price mechanism, but achieves the best-possible guarantee among all possible online algorithms; (2) we tackle the more complex setting with per-step resource constraints by decomposing the regularizer into local components, yielding a similar mechanism with time-dependent marginal pricing functions. To establish the tightness of our results in both settings, we introduce a representative function-based approach that transforms the lower-bound proof into the problem of solving an ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions. We believe that this technique has the potential to be applied to other similar online optimization problems. </p>",

The problem involves allocating a fixed amount of resources to a sequence of agents, each belonging to a specific group. The primary objective is to ensure fairness across different groups in an online setting. We focus on three fairness notions: one based on quantity and two based on utility. To achieve fair allocations, we develop two threshold-based online algorithms, proving their optimality under two fairness notions and near-optimality for the more challenging one. Additionally, we demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between group fairness and individual welfare using a novel representative function-based approach. To address this trade-off, we propose a set-aside multi-threshold algorithm that reserves a portion of the resource to ensure fairness across groups while utilizing the remaining resource to optimize efficiency under utility-based fairness notions. This algorithm is proven to achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off. We also demonstrate that our problem can model a wide range of real-world applications, including network caching and cloud computing, and empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms in the network caching problem using real datasets. </p>",

Previous studies have investigated deterministic dynamic pricing mechanisms for such settings. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in achieving optimality with small or finite inventories and developing effective randomized posted price mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel randomized dynamic pricing mechanism for OSDoS, providing a tighter lower bound on the competitive ratio compared to prior work. Our approach ensures optimal performance in small inventory settings (i.e., whenis small) and surpasses existing online mechanisms in large inventory settings (i.e., whenis large), leading to the best-known posted price mechanism for optimizing online selection and allocation with diseconomies of scale across varying inventory sizes. </p>",

In OSCC, a seller wants to sell some asset to a sequence of buyers with the goal of maximizing his/her profit. The seller can produce additional units of the asset, but at non-decreasing marginal costs. At each time, a buyer arrives and offers a price, and the seller must make an immediate and irrevocable decision in terms of whether to accept the offer and produce/sell one unit of the asset to this buyer. The goal is to develop an online algorithm that selects a subset of buyers to maximize the seller’s profit, namely, the total selling revenue minus the total production cost. Our main result is the development of a class of simple threshold policies that are logistically-simple and easy to implement, but have provable optimality guarantees among all deterministic algorithms. We also derive a lower bound on competitive ratios of randomized algorithms, and prove that the competitive ratio of our threshold policy asymptotically converges to this lower bound when the total production output is sufficiently large. Our results generalize and unify various online search, pricing, and auction problems, and provide a new perspective on the impact of non-decreasing marginal costs on real-world online resource allocation problems. </p>",

We consider an adversarial setting, making no modeling assumptions about buyers’ valuations for the items except acknowledging a finite support. In this paper, we focus on a class of static pricing algorithms that sample a price from a pre-determined distribution and sell items to buyers whose valuations exceed the sampled price. Such algorithms are of practical interests due to their advantageous properties, such as ease of implementation and non-discrimination over prices. Our work shows that the simple static pricing strategy can achieve strong guarantees comparable to the best known dynamic pricing algorithms. Particularly, we design the optimal static pricing algorithms for the adversarial online selection problem and its two important variants: the online assignment problem and the online selection with convex cost. The static pricing algorithms can even attain the optimal competitive ratios among all online algorithms for the online selection problem and the online assignment problem. To achieve these results, we propose an economics-based approach in the competitive analysis of static pricing algorithms, and develop a novel representative function-based approach to derive the lower bounds. We expect these approaches will be useful in related problems such as online matching. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>An electric vehicle based mobility-on-demand (EMoD) system provides shared transportation (e.g., car-sharing or ride-sharing) to satisfy customers’ individual mobility demands. It has been recognized as a vital alternative form of transportation between public and private transportations in future sustainable cities. Constrained by the long charging time and limited driving range of EVs, an operator of an EMoD system demands for decision-making models and algorithms to manage the mobility and energy of EVs to best serve customers with least costs. In this paper, we propose a stochastic dynamic program (DP) to model three operational decisions of the EMoD system: i) dispatching EVs to serve mobility demand from customers, ii) repositioning EVs to accommodate the unbalanced mobility demands between service regions, and iii) recharging EVs to maintain their sufficient state-of-charge levels. To handle this large-scale DP problem, we first observe and prove that it has a coordinate-wise concave value function. Based on this structural property, we propose to use a separable piecewise linear function to approximate the value function and design an approximation-based algorithm to efficiently derive the decision policy. Numerical tests show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing model-free approaches (e.g., greedy heuristic and Q-learning) that fail to take into account the structural properties of the DP problem.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p> Virtual power plants (VPP) can increase reliability and efficiency of power systems with a high share of renewables. However, their adoption largely depends on their profitability, which is difficult to maximize due to the heterogeneity of their components, different sources of uncertainty and potential profit streams. This paper proposes two profit-maximizing operating strategies for a VPP that aggregates solar systems and electric vehicle (EV) chargers with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) support, and generates profit by trading energy in day-ahead and imbalance electricity markets. Both strategies solve a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. In the first stage, energy bids are placed by solving a sequence of linear programs, each formulated for a specific forecast scenario. In the second stage, given the day-ahead commitments and real-time measurements, the decisions with respect to charging or discharging EVs are made sequentially for every hour and adjustments to the day-ahead commitments are settled in the imbalance market. The two strategies differ in how they solve the sequential decision making problem in the second stage. But, they both foresee the effect of their current (dis)charge decisions on the feasibility of fulfilling the EV charging demands using a one-step lookahead technique. The first strategy employs a heuristic algorithm to find a feasible charging schedule for every EV that is connected to a charger. The second one utilizes a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning method with a differentiable projection layer that enforces constraint satisfaction. We empirically evaluate the proposed operating strategies using real market prices, solar traces, and EV charging sessions obtained from a network of chargers in the Netherlands, and analyze how the uptake of V2G could affect profitability of this VPP. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>We study a novel online optimization problem, termed online selection with convex costs (OSCC). In OSCC, there is a sequence of items, each with a value that remains unknown before its arrival. At each step when there is a new arrival, we need to make an irrevocable decision in terms of whether to accept this item and take its value, or to reject it. The crux of OSCC is that we must pay for an increasing and convex cost associated with the number of items accepted, namely, it is increasingly more difficult to accommodate additional items. The goal is to develop an online algorithm that accepts/selects a subset of items, without any prior statistical knowledge of future arrival information, to maximize the social surplus, namely, the sum of the accepted items’ values minus the total cost. Our main result is the development of a threshold policy that is logistically-simple and easy to implement, but has provable optimality guarantees among all deterministic online algorithms.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p> The two-settlement electricity markets are widely accepted. In current practice, the markets are cleared based on locational marginal prices. However, this market clearing scheme leaves arbitrage opportunities between day-ahead and real-time markets for strategic distribution system operators (DSOs). They can submit biased bids from their actual load forecasts in the dayahead market for additional benefits. Worse still, due to the high penetration of distributed energy resources, the impact of such strategic behaviors becomes increasingly severe as the uncertainties in DSOs’ load forecasts increase. In this paper, we first identify the profitable arbitrage opportunities of DSOs and the impact of uncertainties by a simplified analytical model. We then propose a Nash bargaining solution based market clearing scheme for real-time coordination between the transmission system operator and the DSOs. This scheme guarantees the fairness of net-benefit allocation among all the operators, prevents the strategic behaviors of DSOs, and helps the consistency between day-ahead commitment and real-time operation. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on both a simplified system and a practical power system testbed. </p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Battery swapping stations (BSSs) are one of the main types of electric vehicle (EV) refueling facilities. By battery swapping, EVs first replace their depleted batteries (DBs) with fully-charged ones, and then the demounted DBs can be recharged in charging facilities in a stand-alone mode, leading to a decouple between batteries and EVs during refueling. This paper targets the planning and operation of a network of geographically-distributed BSSs, termed as BSS-Net. In particular, we focus on two important decisions being made within two different timescales, namely a long-term decision on planning the initial inventory in each individual BSS, and a short-term decision on real-time vehicle-to-station (V2S) routing of EVs. We formulate a two-stage optimization problem and propose a two-step solution scheme. Specifically, in the first step, we determine the long-term initial inventory by sample average approximation, and the resulting planning decision leads to a maximized total expected revenue for the BSS-Net. Based on the optimal initial inventory, we design a randomized online algorithm in the second step to perform real-time V2S routing, without assuming any future EV arrival information. We rigorously prove that the worst-case performance of the randomized online algorithm is theoretically bounded by a closed-form competitive ratio.</p>",

A provider allocates multiple types of capacity-limited resources to customers that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner.

Although this one-dimensional flexibility has been extensively investigated both by research and industrial implementations, the expanding energy demand and the associated uncertainties still make the integration of a large population of EVs into power system reliably and economically greatly challenging. In this paper, we design an auction scheme via mechanism design to elicit two additional flexibilities from EVs, namely energy flexibility and deadline flexibility. An offline mechanism is firstly designed as a benchmark based on the famous Vickrey–Clark– Groves mechanism. Then based on the primal-dual approach, we propose an online auction, in which all bids are truthful, the loss of social welfare is bounded by competitive ratio, and the mechanism can be implemented in polynomial time. By the numerical results, we quantitatively show that both the power system operators and individual EVs can benefit from the integration of the multi-dimensional flexibilities through our proposed mechanisms.</p>",

A BCS has a certain number of charging bays and maintains a dynamic inventory of fully charged batteries (FBs). This paper studies a BCS scheduling (BCSS) problem whose target is to schedule the charging processes of the charging bays such that the charging cost is minimized while satisfying the FB demand. Specifically, the BCSS problem has two types of operations: 1) loading DBs into the charging bays and then unloading them to the FB inventory when they are fully charged and 2) controlling the charging rate of each charging bay. We formulate the BCSS problem as a mixed-integer program with quadratic battery degradation cost. A generalized benders decomposition algorithm is then developed to solve the problem efficiently. The salience of the developed algorithm is that: 1) each charging bay can solve its own subproblem separately and 2) each subproblem can be further partitioned into multiple independent and identically structured quadratic programming problems, and thus the algorithm facilitates an efficient parallel implementation. We perform extensive real data simulation to validate the optimization model and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>With the rise of transportation electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility in urban mobility systems, and increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources and autonomous demand-side management techniques in energy systems, tremendous opportunities, as well as challenges, are emerging in the forging of a sustainable and converged urban mobility and energy future. This paper is motivated by these disruptive transformations and gives an overview of managing autonomous mobility and energy services in future smart cities. First, we propose a three-layer architecture for the convergence of future mobility and energy systems. For each layer, we give a brief overview of the disruptive transformations that directly contribute to the rise of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. Second, we propose the concept of autonomous flexibility-on-demand (AFoD), as an energy service platform built directly on existing infrastructures of AMoD systems. In the vision of AFoD, autonomous electric vehicles provide charging flexibilities as a service on demand in energy systems. Third, we analyze and compare AMoD and AFoD, and we identify four key decisions that, if appropriately coordinated, will create a synergy between AMoD and AFoD. Finally, we discuss key challenges towards the success of AMoD and AFoD in future smart cities and present some key research directions regarding the system-wide coordination between AMoD and AFoD.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>We present a framework to integrate the choice of electric vehicle (EV) customers into the vehicle-to-station (V2S) routing problem for battery swapping. Instead of assigning stations to each EV customer directly, we provide a recommendation, including a list of station-price pairs that are available for EV battery swapping services, for customers to choose. Compared with assignment, recommendation is closer to reality for scenarios lacking incentives for the cooperation of customers such as the battery swapping services of private EVs. In this paper, we model customers’ behavior by their choice probability given a particular recommendation, which can be readily obtained based on analytics techniques once the real data are available. We propose an online V2S recommendation algorithm, which aims at maximizing the expected revenue of a group of battery swapping stations (BSSs) and ensuring the quality service of EV customers. Leveraging the primal-dual analysis, we show that the loss of revenue due to online EV arrivals is theoretically bounded by a provable competitive ratio. Moreover, numerical tests also validate that the proposed online algorithm can significantly outperform benchmarks in maximizing revenues in online settings.</p>",

However, inappropriate battery charging operation in BSCSs cannot only incur unnecessary high charging cost but also threaten the reliability of the power grid. In this paper, we aim at obtaining an optimal charging operation policy for a single BSCS to minimize its charging cost while ensuring its quality-of-service. Leveraging the novel queueing network model, we propose to formulate the charging operation problem as a constrained Markov decision process and derive the optimal policy by the standard Lagrangian method and dynamic programming. To avoid the curse of dimensionality in practical large-scale systems, we further analyze the structure of the optimal policy and transform the dynamic programming procedure into an equivalent threshold optimization problem with a discrete separable convex objective function. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithms. This paper also shows the impact of the system parameters (e.g., numbers of batteries and chargers) on the average cost under the optimal charging policy, which gives rich insights into the infrastructure planning of future BSCS networks.</p>",

The cloud/ edge-based service, which enables in-motion vehicles to actively offload computation tasks to cloud/edge servers, has provided a promising approach to address the intensive computation burden. However, due to the possibility of disclosing private data, offloading computation tasks suffers from potential eavesdropping attacks. In this article, we focus on the eavesdropping attack when vehicular users (VUs) deliver computation tasks to cloud/edge servers over radio frequency channels. We take the tool of physical layer security and investigate resource management for secrecy provisioning when the VUs offload computation tasks. We then discuss three promising technologies, including non-orthogonal multiple access, multi-access assisted computation offloading, and mobility- and delay-aware offloading, which facilitate the enhancement of secrecy against the eavesdropping attack. Finally, as a detailed example of the multi-access assisted computation offloading, we present a case study on the optimal dual-connectivity-assisted computation task offloading with secrecy provisioning and show the performance of the proposed computation offloading.</p>",

Consequently, the mismatch between the power supply and demand may happen frequently and, thus, lead to frequency deviation from its nominal value. To avoid this scenario, demand-side flexibility has been widely considered to provide frequency regulation services. In this paper, we focus on the flexibility of thermal systems in buildings and propose a hierarchical demand-response market with a three-step algorithm to model the interactions among three entities: the independent system operators (ISOs), aggregators, and end users. The flexibility from the end users is aggregated in step 1, which is based on the incentive and electricity prices broadcasted by the aggregator. A robust optimization approach is adopted to improve the user’s decision under the electricity price uncertainty. To model the interaction between the ISO and aggregators in step 2, a bilevel optimization problem is solved, in which the ISO seeks to minimize its cost, while the aggregators maximize their benefits in the day-ahead market. In step 3, each aggregator allocates its successful trading reserve among end users based on their performance scores.</p>",

Successful deployment of a BSCS system necessitates a careful planning of swapping- and chargingrelated infrastructures, and thus a comprehensive performance evaluation of the BSCS is becoming crucial. This paper studies such a performance evaluation problem with a novel mixed queueing network (MQN) model and validates this model with extensive numerical simulation. We adopt the EVs’ blocking probability as our quality-of-service measure and focus on studying the impact of the key parameters of the BSCS (e.g., the numbers of parking spaces, swapping islands, chargers, and batteries) on the blocking probability. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for showing the ergodicity of the MQN when the number of batteries approaches infinity, and further prove that the blocking probability has two different types of asymptotic behaviors. Meanwhile, for each type of asymptotic behavior, we analytically derive the asymptotic lower bound of the blocking probability.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Historically, transportation electrification has been largely hindered by the limited battery capacity and the long charging time. Battery swapping has emerged as one promising technology to mitigate these problems. A centralised battery charging station (BCS) is responsible for charging depleted batteries (DBs) and providing fully-charged batteries (FBs) for multiple geographically-distributed battery swapping stations (BSSs) so that they can carry out battery swapping services. Facilitated by the recent advancement in sensor and communication technologies, one salient advantage of this centralised approach lies in its convenience to better utilise dual energy sources (i.e. the traditional power grid and local renewable energy generators). This is achieved via optimising the charging processes of a large number of DBs. In this study, the authors propose an optimisation framework for a centralised BCS to minimise the energy cost from the dual energy sources to satisfy the FB demands from multiple BSSs. Particularly, the power dispatch problem in the day-ahead and real-time electricity markets is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimisation through consideration of the intermittent renewable energy. Numerical simulations show that the proposed optimised power dispatch is capable of achieving cost saving of 76% compared with the benchmark, subject to the limited information available in day-ahead.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The cooperation of multiple networked microgrids (MGs) can alleviate the mismatch problem between distributed generation and demand and reduce the overall cost of the power system. Energy management with direct energy exchange among MGs is a promising approach for improving energy efficiency. However, existing methods on microgrid cooperation usually overlook the underlying distribution network with operating constraints (e.g., voltage tolerance and power flow constraints). Hence the results may not be applicable to actual systems. This paper studies the energy management problem of multiple MGs that are interconnected by both the direct current (DC) energy exchange network and the alternating current (AC) traditional distribution networks. In our problem, each MG is equipped with renewable energy generators as well as distributed storage devices. In order to handle the non-convex power flow constraints, we exploit the recent results of the exact optimal power flow (OPF) relaxation method which can equivalently transform the original non-convex problem into a second-order cone programming problem and efficiently determine the optimal solution successfully. The objective of our problem is to minimize the overall energy cost in a distribution network consisting of multiple MGs, with the practical operating constraints (e.g., power balance and the battery’s operational constraints) explicitly incorporated. Considering the privacy and scalability, we propose a distributed algorithm with convergence assurance based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We also implement our method based on the model predictive control (MPC) approach in order to handle the forecasting errors of the renewable energy generation. Simulations are made for different MG exchange topologies on three radial distribution network testbeds. Numerical results demonstrate that certain topologies are more favorable than others, and the cooperation strategy for the energy exchange is significantly affected by the MGs’ locations in the distribution network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>To accommodate the increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration in distribution grid, coordinated EV charging has been extensively studied in the literature. However, most of the existing works optimistically consider the EV charging rate as a continuous variable and implicitly ignore the capacity limitation in distribution transformers, which both have great impact on the efficiency and stability of practical grid operation. Towards a more realistic setting, this paper formulates the EV coordinated discrete charging problem as two successive binary programs. The first one is designed to achieve a desired aggregate load profile (e.g., valley-filling profile) at the distribution grid level while taking into account the capacity constraints of distribution transformers. Leveraging the properties of separable convex function and total unimodularity, the problem is transformed into an equivalent linear program, which can be solved efficiently and optimally. The second problem aims to minimize the total number of on-off switchings of all the EVs’ charging profiles while preserving the optimality of the former problem. We prove the second problem is NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm to approximately achieve our target in an iterative manner. Case studies confirm the validity of our proposed scheduling methods and indicate our algorithm’s potential for real-time implementations.</p>",

In order to reduce the communication and computational complexity of integrating the huge number of DERs into the power system operation, the distribution system operator (DSO) is considered as the central controller to take charge of the dispatch of all the DERs within a distribution network. Through the exchange of boundary power flows and control signals, the independent system operator (ISO) coordinates all the DSOs to achieve certain social objective. In this paper, we study the interactions between the ISO and all the DSOs in both the dayahead market and the real-time balancing market.

However, how to model and evaluate the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) of the energy consumers (such as the flexibilities in terms of energy, power, time period and locations, etc.) is an important and challenging issue. To handle this, we propose a day-ahead market design for the MDF services. In this market, the MDF aggregators need to submit the characteristics of their virtual battery models and parametric reward functions, which represent the aggregate load flexibilities and the required remunerations, respectively. One key feature of this new market is that the system operator is allowed to accept only a portion of every bid instead of the whole of them. This can bring more flexibilities for the operator to minimize the total system cost. With various case studies on a 6-bus transmission network, we show that this market can help flatten the locational marginal prices (LMPs) across the peak load period. Moreover, we show that even if the MDF bids at different buses are the same, the clearing results can be quite different, which reflect the practical values of different load flexibilities from the perspective of the system operator.</p>",

This paper aims to investigate a hybrid energy trading market that is comprised of an external utility company and a local trading market managed by a local trading center (LTC). The existence of local energy market provides new opportunities for the energy consumers and the distributed energy sellers to perform the local energy trading in a cooperative manner such that they all can benefit. This paper first quantifies the respective benefits of the energy consumers and the sellers from the local trading and then investigates how they can optimize their benefits by controlling their energy scheduling in response to the LTC’s pricing. Two different types of the LTC are considered: 1) the nonprofit-oriented LTC, which solely aims at benefiting the energy consumers and the sellers; and 2) the profit-oriented LTC, which aims at maximizing its own profit while guaranteeing the required benefit for each consumer and seller. For each type of the LTC, the optimal trading problem is formulated and the associated algorithm is further proposed to efficiently find the LTC’s optimal price, as well as the optimal energy scheduling for each consumer and seller.

        paperAbstract : "<p>To handle the mismatch problem between local demand and local generation in microgrids (MGs), the paradigm of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing among neighboring MGs has been considered as a promising solution for improving the utilization of local distributed energy resources and saving the energy bills for all MGs. Existing works on cooperative MGs usually consider the high-level energy sharing and trading strategies but little about the physical constraints (e.g. voltage tolerance and power flow constraints) in the underlying distribution network. Hence, their solutions may not be applicable to practical power systems. This paper proposes an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the overall energy cost and the P2P energy sharing losses in a distribution network consisting of multiple MGs and explicitly incorporates the practical constraints (e.g., power balance and battery’s operational constraints). The proposed optimization problem is difficult to solve directly due to the non-convex constraints. Nevertheless, motivated by the very recent result in radial distribution networks, the proposed non-convex optimization problem can be relaxed to a secondorder cone programming (SOCP) problem without incurring any loss of optimality. We apply the proposed problem to a radial distribution network testbed and obtain the corresponding optimal energy management strategy, which exploits the diversified energy consumption profiles to dynamically coordinate multiple MGs and reduces the total energy bill of all MGs. Moreover, an interesting observation from the simulation results is that the cooperation scheme in the P2P sharing network is significantly affected by the MGs’ relative locations in the distribution network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The concept of smart home has attracted considerable attention in recent years, and energy management is one of its key component. This attributes to the growing concern in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as the demands for big data collection from utility companies and policy makers. Current solutions often approach this problem by either the centralized non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or the decentralized smart controls but seldom both, rendering them impractical to some extent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of smart home energy management systems incorporating both approaches, so that accurate power consumption monitoring and intuitive interaction with the home appliances are simultaneously achieved. The smart components directly control the appliances, while the central controller coordinates the data collection and communication. The key feature is the capability of automatically mapping the appliances to their corresponding sockets, reducing the necessity for manual initial setup. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy and efficiency of the framework. We believe that our systems, if widely deployed, can benefit not only individual households by saving energy bills and simplifying life but also society by the big data generated.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>A framework for the simultaneous control of temperature, illumination and window roller blind position is considered. The occupants are allowable to adjust their comfort preference to a strict, mild or loose level. The cost function has two parts including energy consumption and comfort dissatisfaction, each of which is expected to be minimized based on the users’ comfort settings. The control strategy is Model Predictive Control (MPC) and it computes a trajectory of future manipulated variables to optimize future room temperature, illumination and outside view along with the minimum possible departure from the desired level. Weather data like solar radiation, solar illumination and outside temperature are considered in the model with the aim of taking advantage of daylight without disrupting other comfort levels. Simulation analyses were performed for the summer and winter days revealing the influence of the roller blind position on the building total energy consumption. The simulation results affirm that the proposed model can save energy by minimally changing occupants’ comfort requirements during some hours of the day.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>The current mobile broadband market experiences major growth in data demand and average revenue loss. To remain profitable from the perspective of a service provider (SP), one needs to maximize revenue as much as possible by making subscribers satisfied within the limited budget. On the other hand, traffic demands are moving toward supporting the wide range of heterogeneous applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we consider two related packet scheduling problems, i.e., long-term and short-term approaches in the 4th generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) system. In the longterm approach, the long-term average revenue of SP subject to the long-term QoS constraints for heterogeneous traffic demands is optimized. The problem is first formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem, of which the optimal control policy is achieved by utilizing the channel and queue information simultaneously. Subsequently, in the short-term approach, we consider the short-term revenue optimization problem which stochastically guarantees the short-term QoS for heterogeneous traffic demands through a set of chance constraints. To make the proposed chance-constrained programming problem computationally tractable, we use the Bernstein approximation technique to analytically approximate the chance constraint as a convex conservative constraint. Finally, the proposed packet scheduling schemes and solution methods are validated via numerical simulations.</p>",

In SMG, energy consumers and providers, in addition to trading with utility company, can also perform local energy trading controlled by a local trading manager (LTM) for reaping benefits. We first quantify the benefits achieved by the consumers and providers from local trading and then formulate a two-layered optimization framework to investigate i) how the energy consumers and providers maximize their benefits via appropriately adjusting their local trading decisions in response to the LTM’s pricing, and ii) how the LTM adjusts its price in local market to benefit the consumers and providers as much as possible while guaranteeing a required gain for itself.

        paperAbstract : "<p>Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations with battery swapping, as one promising energy supplement solution to cope with the increasing in EVs, demand a theoretical performance analysis framework. In this paper, we propose a queueing network model to serve as such a framework for battery swapping stations with a locally-charging mode. The model is a mixed queueing network with an open queue of EVs and a closed queue of batteries. Based on mild assumptions, we show the equilibrium equations for the queueing system, and the steady-state distribution is the solution of these finite equilibrium equations. In order to show the uniqueness of the solution, we prove the ergodicity of the system. Meanwhile, by leveraging the embedded Markov chain, we present an alternative yet much easier way to compute the steady-state distribution. Based on the steadystate distribution, various important performance indicators have been analytically determined. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the queueing network model and reveal rich insights for the infrastructure planning of practical battery swapping stations.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>This paper proposes a mathematical framework for finding the optimal energy trading policy with battery energy storage (BES) under a dynamic pricing environment. We have previously shown that finding the arbitrage value of BES with known historical price data can be solved by iterative linear programming. The objective of the present paper is to show that, when the price information remains unknown, finding the optimal economic value of lifetime-constrained BES falls within the purview of stochastic shortest path problems, and the optimal policy presents the property of a threshold structure. To overcome the dimensionality difficulty, we propose a structure-based aggregation method, i.e., Layer and Group, to construct optimal trading policies. The elegance of this approach lies in its circumventing of the need for exhausted value iteration over the entire state space. Instead, the approach works in a hierarchical and parallel fashion, thus significantly speeding up the convergence to the optimality. Extensive experimental results show that this approach can dramatically reduce the computational complexity, thus contributing to the computationally tractable optimality without requiring any approximation. Numerical simulation also demonstrates the validity of the proposed framework, and various trading insights for practical BES systems have been formed.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers have an urgent demand for fast battery refueling methods for long distance trip and emergency drive. A well-planned battery swapping station (BSS) network can be a promising solution to offer timely refueling services. However, an inappropriate battery recharging process in the BSS may not only violate the stabilization of the power grid by their large power consumption, but also increase the charging cost from the BSS operators’ point of view. In this paper, we aim to obtain the optimal charging policy to minimize the charging cost while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of the BSS. A novel queueing network model is proposed to capture the operation nature for an individual BSS. Based on practical assumptions, we formulate the charging schedule problem as a stochastic control problem and achieve the optimal charging policy by dynamic programming. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the performance of different policies for both stationary and non-stationary EV arrival cases. Numerical results show the importance of determining the number of total batteries and charging outlets held in the BSS. Our work gives insight for the future infrastructure planning and operational management of BSS network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>In this paper, we investigate the cooperative distributed energy generation and energy trading for future smart grid. In our model, a group of energy users, who are equipped with the capabilities of distributed energy generation, are allowed to trade energy in a cooperative manner with the goal to minimize their total energy-provisioning cost while meeting the local demand of each individual energy user. Moreover, each user also expects to benefit from the cooperative energy generation and trading with the others. Motivated by these objectives, we first jointly determine the optimal energy scheduling decisions for all energy users such that their total energy-provisioning cost can be minimized. Then, based on the optimal energy scheduling decisions, we further determine the optimal transaction costs associated with the users’ energy trading to ensure that each of them can positively benefit from the cooperation. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the advantages of the proposed cooperative energy generation and trading model as well as our proposed algorithms to achieve the optimal solutions.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), as one type of the storage systems, serves as a particularly important role for future power grid systems. However, since both the capital cost of BESS and the potential economic value vary dramatically for large-scale systems, the total cost induced by BESS remains a major source of uncertainty for potential power system operators when the limited lifetime of BESS is taken into account. Therefore, appropriate configuration and operation of BESS are of paramount importance for its deployments in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel model for BESS that attempts to capture the fact of limited lifetime and to exploit the potential economic value. We develop a finite horizon optimization model for BESS operators with unknown stopping-time. The stoppingtime is determined by the policy itself, which makes the problem technically challenging. We first propose an algorithm called Forward-iteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (FirLP), which solves the problem by iterating on every time instance and achieves the optimality. Subsequently, we observe that some time instances are not necessary to be iterated on. Thus, we propose Jumpiteration of relaxed-Linear Programming (JirLP). By utilizing a well defined jump step, we can avoid exhaustive iteration on those unnecessary time instances. We examine our model and algorithms with the real price data. The computational results further validate our model, and shows that our proposed JirLP can achieve optimality and reduce the unnecessary iterations by 50% in comparison with the FirLP.</p>",
