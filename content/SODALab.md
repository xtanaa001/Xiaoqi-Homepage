Welcome to the Systems Optimization & Decision Analytics (SODA) Lab @ [CS-UofA](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html)!

The SODA Lab is dedicated to developing algorithmic solutions to decision making problems in general **dynamical, networked systems**. We develop new mathematical tools in optimization, machine learning, economics, and control, and apply these tools to develop new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees (e.g., robustness, effectiveness, and fairness) in  energy systems, transportation systems, communication networks, and beyond.

Currently, the SODA Lab focuses primarily on the following research topics. 

- Online optimization
- Algorithmic mechanism design
- Stochastic modeling and analysis
- Smart energy and mobility
- Resource allocation

In the SODA Lab, we believe the strength of interdisciplinarity, and our mission is to conduct impactful interdisciplineary research in the general field of “decisions under uncertainty” using mathematical tools from computer science, economics, and control. If you are interested in joining the lab as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see [here](/join).
