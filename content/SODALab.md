Welcome to the SODA Lab - the Systems Optimization & Decision Analytics Lab based at the [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), [Edmonton](https://exploreedmonton.com/), AB, Canada. 

The SODA Lab is dedicated to developing analytical, computational solutions to decision making problems in dynamical, networked systems of large-scale social impact. Our mission is twofold: to conduct rigorous theoretical research in the general field of “decisions under uncertainty,” and to apply theoretical tools to develop new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees  in  energy systems, transportation systems, networking and distributed systems, and beyond.  

In the SODA Lab, we believe the future is interdisciplinary. Together with researchers from various disciplines including computer science, mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, operations research, and economics, the SODA Lab strives to connect theory with practice in modern systems research -- for better decisions!
