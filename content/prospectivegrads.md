title: Prospective Ph.D. Students

<!-- <span style="color:tan">
As an educator and researcher, I strongly believe that when an institution accepts the registration of a student - regardless of races, genders, religions, and classes, we are, in effect, entering a moral, ethical, and legal contract with the student to do whatever we can to help that student succeed.

# `For Prospective Graduate Students`

Thank you for visiting this page!! 

My name is [**Xiaoqi Tan**](https://xiaoqitan.org), an Assistant Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. 

My research focuses on **developing efficient, robust, and explainable solutions to decision making problems in dynamical, networked systems**. The core question my research strives to answer is: What are the best possible **algorithms** and/or **systems** we can design to enable better **decision-making under uncertainty**? To answer this question, my research integrates various analytical and computational tools from computer science, economics, operations research, and  control. 

I enjoy the beauty of mathematics, and consider a technically-sound and aesthetically-elegant theorem the core of publication-worthy results. I admire good applied research, but also believe that not all research needs to have practical use -- good theory sustains over time, and may unexpectedly unleash its power. I am most excited about **connecting theory with practice** to obtain interesting **intuitions and insights** into real-world system design and development. To do so, I believe it is important, and also necessary, to sacrifice certain details of the problem. `I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details. - Albert Einstein`

I often receive emails from prospective students with descriptions like "we've implemented XXX to solve...,"  --- this, unfortunately, is not what I care about the most. I care about whether you can convert a descriptive problem into **rigorous** mathematical models, and then develop algorithms to solve the problem with **provable** guarantees --- in the form of mathematical theorems and lemmas. In short, I look for prospective students who are excited about creating new knowledge -- to argue "**how and why things work**" (with interpretability and explainability).

I respect scholarship and love research, like most academics do. I consider getting a graduate degree takes initiative and commitment --- it requires  **strong motivation to excel**, **long-lasting enthusiasm in research**, and probably most importantly, a **good advisor-advisee match** --- based on mutual trust and respect,  effortless communication, and sometimes, a bit of luck. While it is complex to define what is exactly a "good match," a simple rule of thumb is: if you feel this is the person you are willing to "**work with**," not to "**work for**," then it is usually a good sign.

## `How to Contact Me`

>
I am directing the [**SODALab @ UofA**](https://sodalab.ca). We are constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. and Ph.D. level. Interested candidates should <mark>[**apply here**](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html)</mark> and indicate me as your potential supervisor.  There is no need to send me an enquiry email regarding your application. But if you do want to make personal contact with me, please attach in the email your latest **CV** (in PDF) along with:

>
- **Statement of Interest** (one page in PDF). Your statement should briefly summarize your previous research experience (if any), your research interest, and justify why you are a good fit for my group. If you have any publication, pick the one you feel the most proud of and summarize the major contribution in the statement. If you wish, you can also discuss what you see yourself after obtaining your graduate degree (e.g., pursue an academic career or work in industry). 

>
- **Course Experience** (full transcript in PDF). We may come from different backgrounds such as computer science, applied mathematics, electrical engineering, or operations research, etc. I do NOT expect you to be a straight-A student in your major, but I care about your experience in courses such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, and  algorithms, etc. If you like these courses, you should be comfortable  with, and hopefully confident in, taking my graduate course - [**CMPUT 675: Optimization and Decision Making under Uncertainty**](https://xiaoqitan.org/teaching/optimization/) --  which is a good indication. If you have done some interesting projects in these courses, it is also good to highlight them in your email.

**I apologize for not being able to reply every enquiry email**, especially if your email does not indicate that you've carefully read through this page. If you are already at UofA, feel free to let me know if you want to have a chat.
