## `What I Care About Most in Research?`
>
I am [**Xiaoqi Tan**](/), an Assistant Professor at the [**University of Alberta**](https://www.ualberta.ca) and also a Fellow of the [**Alberta Machine Intelligence Instittue (Amii)**](https://www.amii.ca).  I study optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on exploring the interplay between **algorithms** (for optimization), **learning** (for prediction), and **incentives** (for modeling strategic behaviors) in **online/multi-agent decision-making**. 

>
I enjoy the beauty of mathematics, and consider a technically-sound and aesthetically-elegant theorem the core of publication-worthy results. I admire good applied research, but also believe that not all research needs to have practical use --- good theory sustains over time, and may unexpectedly unleash its power. I am most excited about **connecting theory with practice** to obtain sharp **insights** into real-world systems design, implementation, and operation. To do so, I believe it is important, and also necessary, to sacrifice certain details of the problem. "_I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details." --- Albert Einstein_


## `What I Care About Most in Prospective Students?`
>
I often receive emails from prospective students with descriptions like "I know how to apply $X$ to solve $Y$" --- this, unfortunately, is not what I care about the most. I care about whether you can convert a real-world problem into rigorous **mathematical models**, and then develop algorithms to solve the problem with **provable guarantees** --- in the form of mathematical theorems and lemmas. In short, I look for prospective students who are motivated and excited about creating **new** and **rigorous** knowledge --- to argue â€œhow and why things work."


## `What is My Take on Good Advisor-Advisee Match?`
>
I respect scholarship and love research, like most academics do. I consider getting a graduate degree takes initiative and commitment --- it requires  strong motivation to excel, long-lasting enthusiasm in research, and probably most importantly, a good advisor-advisee match --- based on **mutual trust** and **respect**,  **effortless communication**, and sometimes, a bit of luck. While it is complex to define what is exactly a "good match," a simple rule of thumb is: if you feel this is the person you are willing to "work with," not to "work for," then it is usually a good sign.



## `Should You Write Me an Email?`

>
I am directing the [**SODALab.ca**](https://sodalab.ca). We are constantly looking for graduate students at both the MSc and PhD level. Interested candidates should [**apply here**](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and indicate me as your potential supervisor. <mark>You do not need to send me an email regarding your application</mark>. But if you want to initiate an effective conversation, please send me your CV + Full Transcript + Statement of Interest in **three separate PDF files**. In your statement of interest, please **first indicate that you've carefully read through this page** and then briefly summarize your previous **research experience** (if any), your future **research interest**, and **justify why you are a good fit for my group**. If you have any publication, pick the one you feel the most proud of and summarize your contribution to the paper. If you wish, you can also discuss what you see yourself after obtaining your graduate degree (e.g., pursue an academic career or work in industry).

**I apologize for not being able to reply every inquiry email**. If you are already at UofA, feel free to let me know if you want to have a chat.


<!-- - **Course Experience** (_full_ transcript in PDF). We may come from different backgrounds such as computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and electrical engineering, etc. I do not expect you to be a straight-A student, but I do care about your performance in math/theory courses such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, algorithms, optimization, etc. -->
