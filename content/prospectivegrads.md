## `What I Am Looking for in A Prospective Student`

My research lies in the general field of "**optimization and decision-making under uncertainty**," with aplications to **networked and multi-agent systems** of various types, ranging from energy systems to transportation systems,  communication networks, and beyond. 

The core question my research strives to answer is: **What are the best possible algorithms and systems we can design when facing uncertain inputs**? Depending on different types of "uncertain inputs"  (e.g., online, stochastic, or strategic settings), my research spans various topics in online optimization, stochastic modeling and optimization, and algorithmic game theory.  

I enjoy the beauty of mathematics, and consider a technically-sound and aesthetically-elegant theorem the core of publication-worthy results. I admire good applied research, but also believe that not all research needs to have practical use -- good theory sustains over time, and may unexpectedly unleash its power. I am most excited about **connecting theory to practice with interesting intuitions and insights**. To do so, I believe it is important, and also necessary, to sacrifice a certain details of the problem.  `“I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details.” - Albert Einstein`

I often receive emails from prospective graduate students with descriptions like "we've applied machine learning to ...,"  --- this, unfortunantely, is not what I care about (at least not high in the priority list). I care about whether you can convert a descriptive problem into **rigorous** mathematical models, and then develop algorithms to solve the problem with **provable** performance guarantee --- in the form of mathematical theorems and lemmas. In short, I look for prospective students who are excited about creating new knowledge --- to explain "**how and why things work**," rather than just "**make things work**" (without interpretability and explainability).

I respect scholarship and love research, like most academics do. I consider getting a graduate degree takes initiative and commitment --- it requires  **strong motivation to excel**, **long-lasting enthusiasm in research**, and probably most importantly, a **good advisor-advisee match** --- based on mutual trust and respect,  effortless communication, and sometimes, a bit of luck. While it is complex to define what is exactly a "good match," a simple rule of thumb is: if you feel this is the person you are willing to "**work with**," not to "**work for**," then it is usually a good sign.

## `How to Contact Me`

**I am constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level**.  

Interested candidates should [apply here](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and indicate me as your potential supervisor.  There is no need to send me an enquiry email regarding your application. But if you do want to make personal contact with me, please attach in the email your latest **CV** (in PDF) along with:

- **Statement of Interest** (one page in PDF). In your statement, please briefly summarize your previous research exprience (if any), your research interest, and justify why you are a good fit for my group. If you have any publication, please pick the one you feel the most proud of and summarize the major contribution in the statement. If you want, you can also discuss what do you see yourself after obtaining your graduate degree (e.g., pursue an academic career or work in industry). 

- **Course Experience** (full transcript in PDF). We may come from different backgrounds, e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics, Operations Research, or Control, etc. I do NOT expect you to be a straight-A student in your major, but I care about your experience in math/theory courses such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, and  algorithms, etc. If you like these courses, you should be comfortable  with, and hopefully confident in, taking my [graduate course](/teaching/optcourse) --  which is a good indication. If you have done some interesting projects in these courses, it is also good to highlight them in your email.

**I apologize for not being able to reply every enquiry email**. If you are already at UofA, please feel free to let me know if you want to have a chat.
