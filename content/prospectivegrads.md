# `Letter to Prospective Graduate Students`


Thank you for visiting this page!! 

I am [**Xiaoqi Tan**](/), an Assistant Professor of [**Computing Science**](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [**University of Alberta**](https://www.ualberta.ca) and also a [**Fellow**](https://www.amii.ca/about/our-people/) of the [**Alberta Machine Intelligence Instittue (Amii)**](https://www.amii.ca). My research interests span various topics in “**_optimization and decision-making under uncertainty_**,” with an emphasis on exploring the interplay between _**algorithms**_ (for optimization and control), _**learning**_ (for prediction), and _**incentives**_ (for modeling strategic behaviors) in online/multi-agent decision-making. 

I enjoy the beauty of mathematics, and consider a technically-sound and aesthetically-elegant theorem the core of publication-worthy results. I admire good applied research, but also believe that not all research needs to have practical use--good theory sustains over time, and may unexpectedly unleash its power. I am most excited about **_connecting theory with practice_** to obtain sharp **_insights_** into real-world systems design and operation. To do so, I believe it is important, and also necessary, to sacrifice certain details of the problem. "`I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details." - Albert Einstein`

I often receive emails from prospective students with descriptions like "I know how to apply $X$ to solve $Y$"---this, unfortunately, is not what I care about the most. I care about whether you can convert a descriptive problem into rigorous mathematical models, and then develop algorithms to solve the problem with provable guarantees---in the form of mathematical theorems and lemmas. In short, I look for prospective students who are excited about creating **_new_** and **_rigorous_** knowledge---to argue “how and why things work” (with interpretability and explainability).

I respect scholarship and love research, like most academics do. I consider getting a graduate degree takes initiative and commitment---it requires  strong motivation to excel, long-lasting enthusiasm in research, and probably most importantly, a good advisor-advisee match---based on mutual trust and respect,  effortless communication, and sometimes, a bit of luck. While it is complex to define what is exactly a "good match," a simple rule of thumb is: if you feel this is the person you are willing to "work with," not to "work for," then it is usually a good sign.


## `Write Me an Email?`

I am directing the [**SODALab.ca**](https://sodalab.ca). We are constantly looking for graduate students at both the MSc and PhD level. Interested candidates should <mark>[**apply here**](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html)</mark> and indicate me as your potential supervisor.  There is no need to send me an inquiry email regarding your application. But if you do want to make personal contact with me, please attach in the email your **CV** (in PDF) along with:

>
**Statement of Interest** (_one_ page in PDF). Your statement should briefly summarize your research experience (if any), your research interest, and justify why you are a good fit for my group. If you have any publication, pick the one you feel the most proud of and summarize the major contribution in the statement. If you wish, you can also discuss what you see yourself after obtaining your graduate degree (e.g., pursue an academic career or work in industry).

>
**Course Experience** (_full_ transcript in PDF). We may come from different backgrounds such as computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and electrical engineering, etc. I do NOT expect you to be a straight-A student, but I do care about two things. First, you are expected to have done a fairly good job in math/theory courses such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, algorithms, optimization, etc. Second, you need to be comfortable with the topics coverred in [**CMPUT 676**](https://xiaoqitan.org/teaching/optimization/), which is a graduate course mandatory to all the students in my lab.


I apologize for not being able to reply every inquiry email, especially if your email does not indicate that you've carefully read through this page. If you are already at UofA, feel free to let me know if you want to have a chat.
