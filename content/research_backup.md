Many real-world problems involve making sequential decisions, over a certain horizon, in the presence of incomplete or even zero knowledge of the future. Study of such problems falls within the purview of online optimization, a powerful framework that has seen numerous applications to problems in networks, sustainability, and beyond. 

The knapsack problem, as well as its many variants, has been extensively studied in computer science and operations research communities over the past several decades [1].  As a classic example, the  0-1 knapsack problem considers a combinatorial optimization problem as follows: 
`$$\underset{\{x_n\}_{\forall n}}{\textsf{maximize}}\   \sum_{n=1}^N v_n x_n - f\left(\sum_{n=1}^N x_n\right)\quad  \textsf{subject to}\ \sum_{n=1}^N x_n \leq M; x_n = \{0,1\},\forall n\in[N]$$`
Given a set of $ N $ items indexed by $ n\in [N] $, each with a value $ v_n $ and a weight $ w_n $, one needs to decide whether  item $ n\in [N] $ is to be included in the knapsack (i.e., $ x_n = 0 $) or not (i.e., $ x_n = 0 $) so that the total weight of accepted items is less than or equal to the maximum weight capacity $ M $, and the aggregate value  of accepted items is as large as possible.

The design and analysis of networked systems in settings where multiple agents come together, interact and compete in the presence of strategic behaviors. The knapsack problem, as well as its many variants, has been extensively studied in computer science and operations research communities over the past several decades [1].  As a classic example, the  0-1 knapsack problem considers a combinatorial optimization problem as follows: Given a set of $ N $ items indexed by $ n\in [N] $, each with a value $ v_n $ and a weight $ w_n $, one needs to decide whether  item $ n\in [N] $ is to be included in the knapsack (i.e., $ x_n = 0 $) or not (i.e., $ x_n = 0 $) so that the total weight of accepted items is less than or equal to the maximum weight capacity $ M $, and the aggregate value  of accepted items is as large as possible.
