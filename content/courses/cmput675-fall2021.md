## `Course Overview`

Many real-world problems involves making decisions in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. These challenges arise in Internet advertising, energy sustainability, transportation, financial trading, health, and a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In different application scenarios, the specific decision problems might look different at first glance; however, the models and algorithms needed to address them are often similar.  In this research-oriented course, we will review recent developments and discuss open directions in the general field of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty via several modern optimization lenses. Major topics to be covered in this course include: 

 - Online algorithms and competitive analysis;
 - Stochastic optimization, approximation, and learning; 
 - Algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. 
 
 These topics are highly interdisciplinary - they have strong ties to various disciplines such as theoretical computer science, operations research, statistics, control, decision theory, and economics. The course is theoretical in nature, but most problems considered will be motivated and illustrated by practical examples.



## `Course Policies`

**Grading**: Participation (10%) + Assignments (30%) + Project (20% presentation + 40% written report).

**Homeworks**: The homework assignments will consists of a list of open questions. Solving these questions will need some mathematical derivations, and you may also find it necessary to write some code  to test whether your algorithm really works. (<span style="color:gray">**Tips**: you can prepare your final project by diving deeper into one of these questions and try to obtain some more formal results</span>)

**Textbook**: This course does not require any textbook. There will be a reading list (papers, slides, and/or book chapters, etc) suggested for each lecture.

**Prerequisites**: You should know material in standard UG courses in algorithms, probability, and linear algebra very well. 


## `Course Schedule` 

We will slant towards learning the design and analysis of algorithms for online decision making in settings where the uncertain information is completely unknown. Estimation or prediction of uncertain parameters is not the major focus of this course. 

The exact topics and reading list are still being finalized and **subject to change**.
