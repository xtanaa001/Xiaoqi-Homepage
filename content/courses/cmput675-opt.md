Many real-world problems involves making decisions in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. These challenges arise in Internet advertising, energy sustainability, transportation, financial trading, health, and a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In different application scenarios, the specific decision problems might look different at first glance; however, the models and algorithms needed to address them are often similar. The purpose of this course is to provide a rigorous and insightful treatment of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty via several modern optimization lenses. Major topics to be covered in this course include: i) online optimization, competitive analysis, and beyond worst-case analysis; ii) stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning; iii) algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. These topics are highly interdisciplinary - they have strong ties to various disciplines such as theoretical computer science, operations research, statistics, control, decision theory, and economics. The course is theoretical in nature, but most problems considered will be motivated and illustrated by practical examples.
