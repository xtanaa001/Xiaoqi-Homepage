[comment]: # (**Research**: My research strives to build a rigorous foundation for the modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems, especially in settings where multiple agents come together, interact and compete in the presence of uncertainty and self-interest. To deal with such challenging settings, my research spans various topics in Online Algorithms, Economics and Computation, and Stochastic Modeling. The main theme is to develop novel algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty, with provable performance guarantee (e.g., efficiency, truthfulness, fairness, and privacy), using mathematical tools from computer science, economics, and control.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Research Interests`</span> 

Xiaoqi's research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence. The main theme is to develop foundational theory and algorithms for decision-making problems in highly dynamic,  networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue competing objectives. To deal with such challenging settings, Xiaoqi's research features mathematical rigor and interdiscipinarity, utiliting and contributing to computer science, economics,  operations research, and control. Some major research topics include:

Some current topics of interest include: 

- **Decision-Making under Uncertainty**: online/stochastic optimization; online/reinforcement learning.
- **Algorithmic Mechanism Design**: algorithm design in settings where participants have their own incentives.

I am also passionate about applying these techniques to address societal challenges (e.g., sustainability and fairness) in specific domains such as networking, energy, transportation, and beyond. 

Xiaoqi is also passionate about applying these techniques to address societal challenges in a wide range of application areas, including but not limited to networking, energy, transportation, and online platforms. Click [here](/research) for more details.
