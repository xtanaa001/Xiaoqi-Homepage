## `Research Interests`

Xiaoqi Tan's research strives to develop analytical, computational solutions to decision making problems in dynamical, networked systems. The main theme of his research is to develop new mathematical tools in the general field of "decisions under uncertainty" and apply these tools to develop new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees in  energy systems, transportation systems, networking and distributed systems, and beyond. 

Lately, Xiaoqi's research focuses primarily on online algorithms and mechanism design, and the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and learning in real-time operational management of dynamical, multi-agent systems.
