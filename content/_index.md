Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).  

Xiaoqiâ€™s research interests span various topics in optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on exploring the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and data (for learning and prediction) in online and multi-agent decision-making. Specific topics from his recent focus include online optimization/algorithms, learning-augmented/data-driven algorithms, and mechanism design in multi-agent systems. On the practical side, his research is driven by complex decision-making problems in general dynamical systems such as power systems/smart grid, urban transportation-energy nexus (e.g., electric vehicle networks, mobility-on-demand systems), cloud computing and data centers, etc.
