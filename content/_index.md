Xiaoqi Tan's research strives to develop effective, robust, and explainable solutions to decision-making problems in dynamical, networked systems. The main theme is to develop  analytical and computational tools in the general field of "optimization and decision-making under uncertainty" and apply these tools to develop new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees in  energy systems, transportation systems, networking and distributed systems, and beyond. 

>
Xiaoqi is constantly looking for highly motivated students (undergraduate + graduate) who are interested in algorithms, optimization, machine learning, economics, and control. If you are already at UofA and want to join his lab, feel free to send your CV + transcript to $\textsf{𝗑𝗂𝖺𝗈𝗊𝗂.𝗍𝖺𝗇@𝗎𝖺𝗅𝖻𝖾𝗋𝗍𝖺.𝖼𝖺}$. For prospective students who are not currently enrolled at UofA, see [here](/prospectivegrads).

Lately, research in his lab focuses primarily on online optimization and mechanism design, with particular emphasis on exploring the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and data for online decision-making in the presence of uncertainty and self-interested agents. 

<mark> **Prospective Students** </mark>:  For more details about Xiaoqi’s research, or if you are interested in working with him as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see his research website - [**SODALab @ UofA**](https://sodalab.ca). -->

<!-- <mark>**`Openings`**</mark>: The [SODA Lab @ UofA](https://sodalab.ca) is currently seeking a Postdoctoral Research Fellow for a range of (algorithms + systems)-related research projects on: i) online / stochastic optimization, ii) mechanism / market design, and iii) dynamical / multi-agent systems. Experience in power systems, electricity markets, and network economics is a plus but not required. Interested candidates should email their CV + one representative publication to Dr. [Xiaoqi Tan](https://xiaoqitan.org) ($ \textsf{xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca} $). 
If you are interested in working with him as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see [here](/join).
