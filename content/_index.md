Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and a Fellow of [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).  

Xiaoqiâ€™s research interests span various topics in optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on exploring the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and data (for learning and prediction) in online and multi-agent decision-making. On the practical side, his research is driven by decision-making problems in smart grid, electricity  markets, urban transportation-energy nexus, cloud computing and data centers, etc. For more details, please visit his research website -- the [**SODALab@UofA**](https://sodalab.ca).
