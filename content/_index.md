## `Research Interests`

I am broadly interested in algorithms, optimization, and systems theory. The main theme of my research is to advance the general field of “decisions under uncertainty” by developing new mathematical tools in optimization, machine learning, and algorithmic game theory, with applications to networked and multi-agent systems of various types, ranging from energy to transportation, networking, and beyond.   

For more details, see my selected recent publications below ([full publications](/publications)).

            if (papers_full[i].highlight.search("yes") >= 0) {
                document.write("<li class=paper>");
                printPaper(papers_full[i], "O");
