[comment]: # (**Research**: My research strives to build a rigorous foundation for the modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems, especially in settings where multiple agents come together, interact and compete in the presence of uncertainty and self-interest. To deal with such challenging settings, my research spans various topics in Online Algorithms, Economics and Computation, and Stochastic Modeling. The main theme is to develop novel algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty, with provable performance guarantee (e.g., efficiency, truthfulness, fairness, and privacy), using mathematical tools from computer science, economics, and control.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Research Interests`</span> 

Xiaoqi Tan's research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence -- by developing foundational theory and algorithms for decision-making problems in highly dynamic,  networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives.  To deal with systems challenges in such complex settings, Xiaoqi's research features interdisciplinarity and theoretical rigor, utilizing and contributing to computer science, economics, and operations research. Some current topics of interest include:

>
- **Online Algorithms**: algorithms that process data inputs piece-by-piece in a sequential fashion.
- **Algorithmic Mechanism Design**: algorithm design in settings where participants have their own incentives.
- **Stochastic Modeling and Control**: system modeling, analysis, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Xiaoqi is also passionate about applying these techniques to address societal challenges (e.g., sustainability, fairness, and privacy) in specific domains such as networking, energy, and transportation. Click [here](/publications_year) for more details.
