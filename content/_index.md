<!-- and a Fellow of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://amii.ca) -->

>
Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).  

>
Xiaoqi’s research interests span various topics in optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on exploring the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and data (for learning and prediction) in online/multi-agent decision-making. Specific topics from his recent focus include online/stochastic optimization, learning-augmented algorithms, and mechanism design in multi-agent systems. On the practical side, his research is driven by complex decision-making problems in general dynamical systems such as power systems/smart grid, urban transportation-energy nexus (e.g., electric vehicle networks, mobility-on-demand systems), cloud computing and data centers, etc. 

**Prospective Students/Postdocs**: If you are interested in working with Xiaoqi as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, click [here](https://sodalab.ca) for current openings in his lab.

My research focuses on developing algorithms with provable guarantees in the general field of “optimization and decision-making under uncertainty,” especially in online decision-making settings. On the practical side, my research is motivated by applications in networked systems that have a profound impact on sustainability, such as energy systems, transportation systems, networking and distributed systems, and beyond. For more details, see [here](/research). -->

Lately, research in his lab focuses primarily on online optimization and mechanism design, with particular emphasis on exploring the interplay between algorithms, incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors), and data for online decision-making in the presence of uncertainty and self-interested agents. 

<mark> **Prospective Students** </mark>:  For more details about Xiaoqi’s research, or if you are interested in working with him as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see his research website - [**SODALab @ UofA**](https://sodalab.ca). -->

<!-- <mark>**`Openings`**</mark>: The [SODA Lab @ UofA](https://sodalab.ca) is currently seeking a Postdoctoral Research Fellow for a range of (algorithms + systems)-related research projects on: i) online / stochastic optimization, ii) mechanism / market design, and iii) dynamical / multi-agent systems. Experience in power systems, electricity markets, and network economics is a plus but not required. Interested candidates should email their CV + one representative publication to Dr. [Xiaoqi Tan](https://xiaoqitan.org) ($ \textsf{xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca} $). 
If you are interested in working with him as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see [here](/join).
