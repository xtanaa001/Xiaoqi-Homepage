## `Research Interests`

I study the interplay between algorithms, decisions, and uncertainty in networked systems -- especially in highly dynamic, strategic settings where multiple intelligent agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. The goal is to develop new decision-making tools and algorithms under different forms of uncertainty, with provable performance guarantees, using mathematical tools from computer science, operations research, economics, and control. On the practical side, my research is primarily driven by real-world applications in energy,  transportation, sustainability, and resource allocation.  

`Keywords`: Online Algorithms; Optimization under Uncertainty; Algorithmic Game Theory; Mechanism Design; Netwoked Systems; Multi-Agent Systems; Smart Grid; Resource Allocation
