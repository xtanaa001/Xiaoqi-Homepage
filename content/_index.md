Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and a Fellow of [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

Xiaoqiâ€™s research focuses on developing algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty. His current work centers on algorithm design problems, particularly in resource allocation, that involve two key types of uncertainty: (i) the need to make sequential decisions before the full input is revealed, and (ii) the private, unknown preferences of strategic agents. Examples of such resources include slots in online advertising, distributed energy resources in electrical grids, CPU and memory in cloud computing, and bandwidth in networks.
