Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and a Fellow of [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

Xiaoqi Tanâ€™s research focuses on developing algorithms for _decision-making under uncertainty_ ([course](https://xiaoqitan.org/teaching/optimization/)), with applications to systems and online platforms shaped by dynamics and strategic behavior. His current research focuses on two key challenges in algorithm and systems design: (i) making sequential decisions without access to the full input in advance (_online algorithms_), and (ii) managing and allocating resources, incentives, and interactions in economic settings while ensuring computational feasibility and performance guarantees (_algorithmic economics_).
