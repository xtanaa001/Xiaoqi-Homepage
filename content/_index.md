Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and a Fellow of [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

Xiaoqiâ€™s research strives to optimize decision-making in dynamic, uncertain, and possibly strategic environments, using tools and insights from computer science, economics, and operations research. Specifically, his current research spans various theoretical topics in the general field of _decision-making under uncertainty_, with an emphasis on online optimization, algorithmic game theory, and sequential decision and learning theory. On the practical side, Xiaoqi is also interested in developing new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees to address real-world systems challenges across various fields, including electrical grids, transportation systems, and computing systems and networks.
