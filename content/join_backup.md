DINSLab is a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and systems engineers based at UofA, striving to advance the general field of decision intelligence for networked systems (DINS).  We are engaged in multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research with projects ranging from theoretical research in  optimization, game theory, machine learning, and economics, to applied research driven by societal challenges such as energy and urban sustainability.  If you are interested in joining the lab as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see the description below.

### <span style="color:#00204e"> Prospective Undergraduate Researchers </span> 
>
Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computing science (e.g., algorithms, AI/ML, data science, and applications). UofA undergraduates can join DINSLab either for summer internship, or for projects during the academic year (which is better if you want to pursue a long-term objective). Email me if you are interested.

### <span style="color:#00204e"> Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.) </span> 
>
I am constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level. Interested candidates should [apply here](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and indicate me as your potential supervisor. If already a UofA student, please email a short description of interests and CV to xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca.

### <span style="color:#00204e"> Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows </span>
>
I am looking for postdocs (subject to funding availability) in a variety of areas, including but not limited to: i) online algorithms, ii) stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning, and iii) economics and computation (e.g., resource allocation, pricing, auctions, and markets). Interested candidates please email your detailed CV and one representative publication to xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca. I might approach you if there is a match in background and research interests.
