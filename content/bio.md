## About Me

Xiaoqi Tan is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He completed his Ph.D. at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D., he was a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

Xiaoqi Tan's research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence -- by developing foundational theory and algorithms for decision-making problems in highly dynamic,  networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives.  To deal with systems challenges in such complex settings, Xiaoqi's research features interdisciplinarity and theoretical rigor, utilizing and contributing to computer science, economics, and operations research. Some current topics of interest include: online algorithms, algorithmic mechanism design, and stochastic modeling and control, with applications in networking, energy, transportation, and beyond.
