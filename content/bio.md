Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.

Xiaoqiâ€™s research strives to develop efficient, robust, and explainable solutions to decision making problems in dynamical, networked systems. The main theme of his research is to develop new mathematical tools in the general field of "optimization and decision-making under uncertainty" and apply these tools to develop new algorithms and markets with provable guarantees in  energy systems, transportation systems, networking and distributed systems, and beyond. Lately, Xiaoqi's research focuses primarily on online optimization and mechanism design, and the interplay between algorithms, incentives, and learning in design and analysis of large-scale dynamical, multi-agent systems.
