## About Me

Xiaoqi Tan is an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). Before that, he completed his Ph.D. at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D., he was a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

Xiaoqi's research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence -- by developing foundational decision-making tools and algorithms in highly dynamic, networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives.  To deal with systems challenges in such complex settings, his research features algorithm and market design using tools from optimization, machine learning, and economics, with applications in networking, energy, transportation, and beyond.
