Xiaoqiâ€™s research focuses on developing algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty, with applications to systems and online platforms shaped by dynamics and strategic behavior. His current work centers on algorithm design problems that involve two key challenges: (i) the need to make sequential decisions before the full input is revealed (online algorithms), and (ii) the presence of private, unknown preferences among self-interested agents in resource allocation and market design (algorithmic economics). Xiaoqi is a member of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/), and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/). He has acted as technical reviewer for CS/OR journals such as [Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair), [Management Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc), [Stochastic Systems](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/stsy), [Transportation Research (Part B)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-part-b-methodological), [Performance Evaluation](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/performance-evaluation), [European Journal of Operations Research](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-journal-of-operational-research), and [Computers & Operations Research](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-operations-research). He is also a frequent reviewer for IEEE journals  including [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=90), [IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9), [IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=49), [IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (TPS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=59), [IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid (TSG)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5165411), and [IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979).
