## `Biography`


Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.


Xiaoqi's research focuses on understanding the interplay between algorithms, decisions, and uncertainty in networked  systems - especially in highly dynamic, strategic settings where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. The goal is to develop new decision-making tools and algorithms that can provide provable performance guarantees under different forms of uncertainty, using mathematical tools from computer science, optimization, economics, and control. 

Xiaoqi is a member of ACM, ACM SIGMETRICS, ACM SIGEnergy, and IEEE. He has acted as reviewer for Computer Science, Operations Research, and Electrical Engineering journals such as Performance Evaluation, Stochastic Systems,  European Journal of Operations Research, Computers & Operations Research, IEEE-ToN, IEEE-TAC,  IEEE-TPS, IEEE-TSG, and IEEE-TITS.
