## `Biography`


Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.

Xiaoqi's research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence - by developing foundational decision-making tools and algorithms in highly dynamic, networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. To deal with systems challenges in such complex settings, his research spans various topics in online algorithms, economics and computation, and stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning,  with applications in networking, energy, transportation, and beyond. 

Xiaoqi is a member of ACM, ACM SIGMETRICS, ACM SIGEnergy, and IEEE. He has acted as reviewer for Computer Science, Operations Research, and Electrical Engineering journals such as Performance Evaluation, Stochastic Systems,  European Journal of Operations Research, Computers & Operations Research, IEEE-ToN, IEEE-TAC,  IEEE-TPS, IEEE-TSG, and IEEE-TITS.
