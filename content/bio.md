## `Biography`


Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.


Xiaoqi's research spans various topics in online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning. The main theme is to develop algorithms and decisions under uncertainty, with provable performance guarantees, using mathematical tools from computer science, optimization, economics, and control. On the practical side, his research is primarily driven by systems challenges arising from energy, transportation, and cloud computing. He is particularly interested in understanding fundamental performance tradeoffs between robustness, effectiveness, and fairness in the design and operation of dynamic multi-agent systems - settings where multiple participants come together sequentially, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives.

Xiaoqi is a member of ACM, ACM SIGMETRICS, ACM SIGEnergy, and IEEE. He has acted as reviewer for Computer Science, Operations Research, and Electrical Engineering journals such as Performance Evaluation, Stochastic Systems,  European Journal of Operations Research, Computers & Operations Research, IEEE-ToN, IEEE-TAC,  IEEE-TPS, IEEE-TSG, and IEEE-TITS.
