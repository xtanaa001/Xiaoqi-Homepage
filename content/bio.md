## `Biography of Xiaoqi Tan`

Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor in the [Dept. of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) and a Fellow of [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca/). Prior to July 2021, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018. During his Ph.D.,  he was also a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).  


Xiaoqiâ€™s research interests span various topics in optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on exploring the interplay between algorithms (for optimization), learning (for prediction), and incentives (for modeling strategic behaviors) in online/multi-agent decision-making. On the practical side, his research is driven by optimization and decision-making problems in smart grid, electricity markets, urban transportation-energy nexus, cloud computing and data centers, etc.

Xiaoqi is a member of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/), and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/). He has acted as technical reviewer for Computer Science and Operations Research journals such as [Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair), [Management Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc), [Stochastic Systems](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/stsy), [Performance Evaluation](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/performance-evaluation), [European Journal of Operations Research](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-journal-of-operational-research), and [Computers & Operations Research](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-operations-research). He is also a frequent reviewer for IEEE journals  including [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=90), [IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (TAC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9), [IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=49), [IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (TPS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=59), [IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid (TSG)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5165411), and [IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6979).
