## `Biography`


Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor of [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.


Xiaoqi's research focuses on developing decision-making tools and algorithms in networked systems, especially in highly dynamic and strategic settings where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. To deal with algorithmic challenges in such complex settings, his research spans various topics at the intersection of online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning.  On the practical side, his research is primarily driven by applications in energy and transportation systems, and the nexus between them in particular.  

Xiaoqi is a member of ACM, ACM SIGMETRICS, ACM SIGEnergy, and IEEE. He has acted as reviewer for Computer Science, Operations Research, and Electrical Engineering journals such as Performance Evaluation, Stochastic Systems,  European Journal of Operations Research, Computers & Operations Research, IEEE-ToN, IEEE-TAC,  IEEE-TPS, IEEE-TSG, and IEEE-TITS.
