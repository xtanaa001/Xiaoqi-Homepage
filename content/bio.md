## `Biography`

>
Xiaoqi Tan is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). He received his Ph.D.  from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018.

Xiaoqi's research focuses on understanding the interplay between algorithms, decisions, and uncertainty in networked  systems -- especially in highly dynamic, strategic settings where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. The goal is to develop new decision-making tools and algorithms, with provable performance guarantees, under different forms of uncertainty, using mathematical tools from computer science, optimization, economics, and control. On the practical side, his research is primarily driven by real-world applications in energy,  networks, and resource allocation.
