## `Course Overview`

Many real-world problems involves making decisions, over a period of time, in the presence of different forms of uncertainty. These challenges arise in Internet advertising, energy sustainability, transportation, ﬁnancial trading, health, and a wide range of problems in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning. In different application scenarios, the speciﬁc decision problems might look different at ﬁrst glance; however, the models and algorithms needed to address themareoften similar. 

In this research-oriented course, we will review recent developments and discuss open direc- tions in the general ﬁeld of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty via severalmodern optimization lenses. Major topics to be covered in this course include:

- Part-1: Online algorithms and competitive analysis; 
- Part-2: Stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning; 
- Part-3: Algorithmic game theory and mechanism design;

These topics are highly interdisciplinary - they have strong ties to various disciplines such as theoretical computer science, operations research, statistics, control, decision theory, and eco- nomics. The course is theoretical in nature, but most problems considered will be motivated and illustrated by practical examples.


## `Course Policies`

**Textbook**: This course does not require any textbook. There will be a reading list (e.g., papers, slides, and/or book chapters) suggested for each lecture.

**Prerequisites**: You should know material in standard UG courses in calculus, linear algebra, probability, and algorithms very well. Having some optimization background will be a bonus. 

**Grading**: Participation (10%); Assignments (20%); Project: Proposal (20%) + Presentation (20%) + Report (30%).

**Homeworks**: There are three research-oriented questions, and you are free to pick any one from the list. Solving these questions will need some mathematical derivations, and you may also ﬁnd it necessary to write some code to show some numerical results. (_Tips: treat it as a mini-project_)
