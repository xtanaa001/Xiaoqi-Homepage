## Course Overview
One of the primary goals of AI is the design, control and analysis of agents or systems that behave appropriately in various circumstances. Such intelligent agents require not only the ability to act but also to decide how to act as circumstances vary. In turn, good decision making requires that the agent have knowledge or beliefs about its environment and its dynamics (including the presence of other agents), about its own abilities to observe and change the environment, and its goals and preferences. In this course, we will examine some of the techniques for modeling decision problems of various types and the computational methods used to solve them. The course will focus on probabilistic models: probabilistic inference, decision making under uncertainty, and game theoretic models of multiagent interaction will be the emphasis.
