## JOIN

<span style="color:#00204e">
We are a group of computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and systems engineers based at CS@UAlberta.  The group is engaged in multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research with projects ranging from theoretical research in  optimization, machine learning, and algorithmic  game theory/mechanism design,  to applied research driven by societal challenges in energy,  transportation, online platforms, and beyond. For more information about joining the group, see the description below.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Undergraduate Researchers`</span> 
I am always interested in having motivated UAlerbta undergraduates join my group either for summer intership, or for mutually-interested projects during the academic year. Email me if you are interested.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)`</span> 
For students who are already at UAlberta: I have multiple openings starting in Fall 2021 or 2022, email me if you are interested.  You can get a good sense of my research from this website, but you are always welcome to drop by my office to have a chat.

For students who are not at UAlberta: If you are interested in working with me for your M.Sc. and Ph.D., I encourage you to directly [apply to my department](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and mention my name.  If you want to make personal contact with me, please provide **a single PDF** file which includes a one-page statement of your research interests and a detailed CV.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows`</span>
I am looking for postdocs in a variety of areas, including but not limited to: i) optimization and machine learning, ii) stochastic modeling and control, and iii) economics of networks, energy, and computation. If you are interested in working with me as a postdoc in any (or more) of these areas, please send me your CV and one representative publication. I might get back to you if there is a match in research interests and background.
