We are a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and systems engineers based at UofA, striving to advance the general field of decision intelligence in networked systems.  The group is engaged in multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research with projects ranging from theoretical research in online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning, to applied research driven by societal challenges in energy, transportation,  sustainability, and beyond.  If you are interested in joining the group as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see the description below. 


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Undergraduate Researchers` </span> 

Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computing science (e.g., algorithms; optimization; machine learning; data science; systems,  networks, and applications). UofA undergraduates can join the group either for summer internship, or for projects during the academic year (which is better if you want to pursue some long-term research objectives). Email me if you are interested.


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)` </span> 

I am constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level. You can get a good sense of my research from this website. Interested candidates should [apply here](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and indicate me as your potential supervisor. If already a UofA student, please email me a short description of interests and CV. 



## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows` </span>

I am interested in hosting postdocs in a variety of areas, including but not limited to: i) online algorithms and online optimization, ii)  algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, iii) stochastic modeling, optimization, and learning, and iv) energy systems and the urban energy-transport nexus. Interested candidates please email me your detailed CV and one representative publication. I might approach you if there is a match in background and research interests.
