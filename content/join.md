We are a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and systems engineers based at UofA, striving to advance the theory and practice of "optimization and decision-making under uncertainty."  Our research interests span various topics in online algorithms, online optimization, algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and  stochastic modeling and optimization, with applications to networked and multi-agent systems of various types, ranging from energy systems to transportation systems, communication networks, and beyond.  

If you are interested in joining the group as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see the description below. 


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Undergraduate Researchers` </span> 

Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computing science (e.g., algorithms, data science, machine learning, and systems & networks, etc.). UofA undergraduates can join the group either for summer internship, or for projects during the academic year (which is better if you want to pursue some long-term research objectives). Email me if you are interested.


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)` </span> 

I am constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level. Check out [**here**](/prospectivegrads) for what I am looking for in a prospective student. 


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows` </span>

I am interested in hosting postdocs (subject to funding availability) in a variety of areas, including but not limited to: i) online algorithms; online optimization, ii)  algorithmic game theory; mechanism design, iii) stochastic modeling, optimization, and approximation, and iv) energy systems and the urban energy-transport nexus. Interested candidates please email me your CV and one representative publication. I might approach you if there is a match in background and research interests.
