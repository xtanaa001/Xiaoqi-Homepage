## <a id="prospective"></a> `For Prospective Students`


I am always looking for highly motivated students at all levels (undergraduate, MSc, and PhD). Below are some useful links to learn more about my research:

- [**`SODALab @UofA`**](https://sodalab.ca) page — contains up-to-date information about my research group, including our latest publications, member highlights, and details on how to join depending on your current status.
- [**`Letter to Prospective Students`**](/letter2students/) — outlines my core values in research and mentoring, as well as guidelines on how best to reach out. If you decide to email me, please review this letter first.
- [**`CMPUT 676`**](/teaching/cmput676/) course page — provides an overview of the research themes that align closely with the ongoing work in my group. Interested students may find it helpful to review the page; the course was most recently offered in Fall 2024.

If you’re already at UofA: My group meets weekly at the SODALab Seminar, which is open to anyone interested in attending. [**`Click here`**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gR2qVvK1fLDB_uvyKxTtVmQCDb6QMwXqIeh3m6HbEkk/edit#gid=1884220804) to view our past and upcoming schedules.

If you've never been to UofA: Here are some links to help you virtually explore [the city of **`Edmonton`**](https://exploreedmonton.com/) and [the province of **`Alberta`**](https://www.travelalberta.com/).
