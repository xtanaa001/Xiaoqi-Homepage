<!-- > <mark>**`Openings`**</mark>: We are constantly looking for highly motivated students (both undergraduate and graduate) who are interested in algorithms, optimization, machine learning, and systems research. If you are already at UofA and want to join the SODA Lab, feel free to send your CV + transcript to Dr. Xiaoqi Tan ($\textsf{xtan@sodalab.ca}$). For prospective students who are not currently enrolled at UofA, check out [**here**](https://xiaoqitan.org/prospectivegrads) for more details.

## `Prospective Undergraduate Researchers` 
>
Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computer science (e.g., algorithms, data science, machine learning, and systems & networks, etc.). UofA undergraduates can join the group either for summer internship, or for projects during the academic year (which is better if you want to pursue some long-term research objectives). Send your email to Dr. [Xiaoqi Tan](https://xiaoqitan.org) ($ \textsf{xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca} $) if you are interested. 


## `Prospective Graduate Researchers`  
>
We are constantly looking for highly motivated graduate students (both M.Sc. and Ph.D.) who are interested in algorithms, optimization, machine learning, economics, and control. Check out [**here**](https://xiaoqitan.org/prospectivegrads) for more details. 


## `Prospective Postdoctoral Research Fellows`
>
If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, please send your latest CV + one representative publication to  Dr. [Xiaoqi Tan](https://xiaoqitan.org) ($ \textsf{xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca} $). We might approach you if there is a match in background and research interests (subject to funding availability). 

## `Prospective Visiting Researchers`
>
We welcome visitors from a range of disciplines such as computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, operations research, and economics. If you believe we share some common research interest and want to visit the lab, feel free to reach out.
