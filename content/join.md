<span style="color:#00204e">
We are a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and systems engineers based at [CS](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html)@[UAlberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html).  The group is engaged in multi-disciplinary cutting-edge research with projects ranging from theoretical research in  optimization, machine learning, and economics, to applied research driven by societal challenges (e.g., sustainability and fairness) in networking, energy,  transportation, and beyond. For information on joining the group, see the description below.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Undergraduate Researchers`</span> 
Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computing science (e.g., algorithms/theory, AI/ML, data science, and systems/networking). UAlberta undergraduates can join my group either for summer intership, or for long-term projects during the academic year. Email me if you are interested.

### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)`</span> 
My
 group is constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level. Interested candidates should [apply here](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/index.html) and indicate Dr. Xiaoqi Tan as your potential supervisor. If already a UAlberta student, please email a short description of interests and CV to $\textsf{xiaoqi.tan}$`@`$\textsf{ualberta.ca}$. 


### <span style="color:#00204e">`Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows`</span>
I am looking for postdocs in a variety of areas, including but not limited to: i) sequential decision making under uncertainty (esp. online/stochastic optimization and online/reinforcement learning), and ii) economics and computation of networked systems (esp. resource allocation, pricing, incentives, fairness, markets, and mechanism design). Interested candidates please email your detailed CV and one representative publication to $\textsf{xiaoqi.tan}$`@`$\textsf{ualberta.ca}$. I might approach you if i) there is a match in background and research interests (this is very important) and ii) funding is available (sadly, this is also very important).
