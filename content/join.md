We are a research lab based at CS@UAlberta, striving to conduct impactful interdisciplineary research in Systems Optimization & Decision Analytics. If you are interested in joining the lab as an undergraduate, graduate, or postdoc, see the description below.


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Undergraduate Researchers` </span> 

Undergraduate research positions are available in the broad area of computing science (e.g., algorithms, data science, machine learning, and systems & networks, etc.). UofA undergraduates can join the group either for summer internship, or for projects during the academic year (which is better if you want to pursue some long-term research objectives). Email me if you are interested.


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Graduate Researchers (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)` </span> 

I am constantly looking for graduate students at both the M.Sc. level and the Ph.D. level. Check out [**here**](/prospectivegrads) for more details. 


## <span style="color:#00204e"> `Prospective Postdoctoral Fellows` </span>

If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, please email to xiaoqi.tan@ualberta.ca your CV and one representative publication. We might approach you if there is a match in background and research interests (subject to funding availability).
