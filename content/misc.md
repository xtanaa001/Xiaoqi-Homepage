- My first name "Xiaoqi" is pronounced as "Shiao-Chee".
- I am into jogging. This is my favorite place to run in Toronto, weather permitting: [Kay Gardner Beltline Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7070406-Reviews-Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Trail-Toronto_Ontario.html).

[comment]: # (- I am big fun of [Chinese caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy). My favorite calligraphers are  [Ouyang Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xun) and  [Wang Xizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xizhi).)
