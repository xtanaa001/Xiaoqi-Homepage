Xiaoqi Tan's research interests spans various topics in sequential decisions under uncertainty and economics of networks and computation. The main theme of his research is to advance the general field of decision intelligence â€“ by developing foundational decision-making tools and algorithms in highly dynamic, networked systems where multiple agents come together, interact and possibly pursue divergent or even conflicting objectives. To deal with systems challenges in such complex settings, his research features algorithm and market design, with rigorous performance guarantees, using tools from optimization, machine learning, and economics. On the practical side, his research is primarily driven by societal challenges in networks, energy, transportation, and beyond.
