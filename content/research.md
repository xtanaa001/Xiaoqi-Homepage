## RESEARCH

My research strives to advance the general field of decision intelligence. The main theme is to develop foundational theory and algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty, with applications to large-scale systems in networking, energy, and transportation.



Specifically, I am interested in understanding how to enable intelligent decision making when the full knowledge of the future in not available. To address these challenges, my research features interdisciplinarity, utilizing and contributing to computer science, economics, and operations research.

On the practical side,  my research is primarily driven by applications in large-scale networked systems and multi-agent systems. Current research topics are listed below.
