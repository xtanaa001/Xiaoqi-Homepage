Teaching & learning in computer science - probably in many other disciplines as well - should always search for a balance between rigor and intuition. Being rigorous in theory will give us the fearlessness to think critically, to challenge the status quo, and most importantly, to pursue the truth without ambiguity. An intuitive understanding, on the other hand, will help us better retain important information in our learning, and hence better utilize the knowledge whenever needed - in years or even decades to come.
