Searching for a good balance between _rigor_ and _intuition_ is both enjoyable and crucial in teaching and learning, especially in Computer Science. Being rigorous in theoretical foundations empowers us to think critically, challenge the status quo, and, most importantly, pursue the truth without ambiguity. On the other hand, an intuitive understanding helps us retain important information more effectively, allowing us to utilize the knowledge whenever and wherever neededâ€”possibly even beyond the intended scope of a course.
